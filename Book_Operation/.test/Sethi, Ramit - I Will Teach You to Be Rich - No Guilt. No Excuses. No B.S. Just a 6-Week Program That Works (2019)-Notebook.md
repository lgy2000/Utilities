# Sethi, Ramit - I Will Teach You to Be Rich - No Guilt. No Excuses. No B.S. Just a 6-Week Program That Works (2019)

## Would You Rather Be Sexy or Rich?

- The 85 Percent Solution: Getting started is more important than becoming an expert. Too many of us get overwhelmed thinking we need to manage our
  money perfectly, which leads us to do nothing at all. That’s why the easiest way to manage your money is to take it one step at a time— and not
  worry about being perfect. I’d rather act and get it 85 percent right than do nothing. Think about it: 85 percent of the way is far better than zero
  percent. Once your money system is good enough— or 85 percent of the way there— you can get on with your life and go do the things you really want
  to do.
- It’s okay to make mistakes. It’s better to make them now, with a little bit of money, so that when you have more, you’ll know what to avoid.
- Spend extravagantly on the things you love and cut costs mercilessly on the things you don’t.This
- Don’t live in the spreadsheet. I encourage you to pick your financial system and move on with your life, which means not “living in the
  spreadsheet,” or obsessing over every tiny change in your spending and in the market.
- I began writing a blog called “I Will Teach You to Be Rich,” covering the basics of saving, banking, budgeting, and investing.
- If you don’t consciously choose what “rich” means, it’s easy to end up mindlessly trying to keep up with your friends.
- 10 Rules for a Rich Life
- Focus on the Big Wins— the five to ten things that get you disproportionate results, including automating your savings and investing, finding a job
  you love, and negotiating your salary. Get the Big Wins right and you can order as many lattes as you want.
- Investing should be very boring— and very profitable— over the long term.
- There’s a limit to how much you can cut, but no limit to how much you can earn. I have readers who earn $ 50,000/ year and ones who earn $ 750,000/
  year. They both buy the same loaves of bread. Controlling spending is important, but your earnings become super-linear.
- Build a collection of “spending frameworks” to use when deciding on buying something. Most people default to restrictive rules (“ I need to cut back
  on eating out...”), but you can flip it and decide what you’ll always spend on, like my book-buying rule: If you’re thinking about buying a book,
  just buy it. Don’t waste even five seconds debating it.
- Sometimes the most advanced thing you can do is the basics, consistently.
- Part of creating your Rich Life is the willingness to be unapologetically different. Once money isn’t a primary constraint, you’ll have the freedom
  to design your own Rich Life, which will almost certainly be different from the average person’s.
- Investing isn’t about picking stocks. In fact, your investment plan is actually more important than any individual investment you make.
- I Will Teach You to Be Rich will help you figure out where your money is going and redirect it to where you want it to go.
- action Steps IN WEEK 1, you’ll set up your credit cards, pay off debt (if applicable), and learn how to master your credit history and free credit
  rewards. IN WEEK 2, you’ll set up the right bank accounts. IN WEEK 3, you’ll open a 401( k) and an investment account (even if you have just $ 100
  to start). IN WEEK 4, you’ll figure out how much you’re spending. And then you’ll figure out how to make your money go where you want it to go. IN
  WEEK 5, you’ll automate your new infrastructure to make your accounts play together nicely. IN WEEK 6, you’ll learn why investing isn’t the same as
  picking stocks— and how you can get the most out of the market with very little work.
- You’ll also learn to choose a low-cost automatic portfolio that beats typical Wall Street portfolios, and find out how to maintain your investments
  by setting up a system that lets you remain as hands-off as possible while your money accumulates automatically. Plus, I provide answers to many
  specific money questions, including how to buy a car, pay for a wedding, and negotiate your salary.

## Optimize Your Credit Cards

- How to beat the credit card companies at their own game
- It’s not worth negotiating everything, but there are a few areas of life where negotiation is a Big Win.
- Credit cards give you thousands of dollars worth of perks. If you pay your bill on time, they’re a free short-term loan. They can help you keep
  track of your spending much more easily than cash, and they let you download your transaction history for free. Most offer free warranty extensions
  on your purchases and free rental car insurance. Many offer rewards and points worth hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Credit cards are also
  convenient enemies. Almost everyone has a bad story about late fees, unauthorized charges, or overspending.
- The truth about credit cards lies somewhere between these two extremes. As long as you manage them well, they’re worth having. But if you don’t
  completely pay off your bill at the end of the month, you’ll owe an enormous amount of interest on the remainder, usually about 14 percent. This is
  what’s known as the annual percentage rate, or APR. Credit card companies also tack on a whopping fee every time you miss a payment— usually
  around $ 35. It’s also easy to overuse credit cards and find yourself in debt, as many American credit card users have done.
- instead of playing defense by avoiding credit cards altogether, I want you to play offense by using credit cards responsibly and getting as many
  benefits out of them as possible. To do so, you need to optimize your credit card( s) and use them as a spearhead to improve your overall credit. By
  the end of this chapter, you’ll know how to squeeze the credit card companies for everything they’re worth— without paying unnecessary fees— and
  you’ll know how to use your cards to boost your all-important credit score.
- When I was traveling with my fiancée to see her family in Dubai, I surprised her with a three-night stay at a resort in the desert that could only
  be described as 7-star. We had a private villa in traditional bedouin style overlooking the Dubai desert with a private pool, and all meals at the
  resort were provided. The whole experience easily would have cost $ 2,000-plus a night, but I did the whole thing for free with points.
- For student loans, make an aggressive plan and minimize the amount of interest you pay. For credit cards, I squeeze every single benefit out of
  them. Basically I want the credit card companies to hate you, as they hate me.
- In the past year since I started this book, I opened a 401( k) and a Roth IRA, understand how they work, and have funded $ 7,200 toward my
  retirement. I also opened 2 credit cards to build my utilization and boost my credit score and am 100 percent a deadbeat customer who pays on time
  every month in full.
- I learned how to automate my credit card payments, set up flexible spending, and start investing in index funds. Today I have amassed over $ 40,000
  in my “net worth,” having been out of school for less than 2 years. Thanks for the advice!
- Bank of America, one of the world’s shittiest banks,
- establishing good credit is the first step in building an infrastructure for getting rich. Think about it: Our largest purchases are almost always
  made on credit, and people with good credit save tens of thousands of dollars on these purchases. Credit has a far greater impact on your finances
  than saving a few dollars a day on a cup of coffee.
- There are two main components to your credit (also known as your credit history): your credit report and your credit score.
- Your credit report gives potential lenders basic information about you, your accounts, and your payment history. It tracks all credit-related
  activities (e.g., credit cards and loans), although recent activities are given higher weight.
- Your credit score (often called your FICO score because it was created by the Fair Isaac Corporation) is a single, easy-to-read number between 300
  and 850 that represents your credit risk to lenders. It’s like an SAT score for the credit industry (higher is better). The lenders take this number
  and, with a few other pieces of information, such as your salary and age, decide if they’ll lend you money for credit like a credit card, mortgage,
  or car loan. They’ll charge you more or less for the loan depending on your score, which signifies how risky you are.
- Once a year, by law, you’re allowed to obtain your credit report for free at annualcreditreport.com. It includes basic information about all your
  accounts and payment history. Lots of people use Credit Karma (creditkarma.com) to get a free credit score, but I prefer the official credit score
  from MyFico (myfico.com), which is more accurate even though it has a small fee.
- a high credit score can save you tens of thousands of dollars over your lifetime (or more if you live in a high-cost-of-living area). While other
  people spend many hours cutting coupons, agonizing over generic brands at the grocery store, or beating themselves up over a morning latte, they’re
  failing to see the bigger picture. It’s fine to keep a close eye on your expenses, but you should focus on spending time on the things that matter,
  the Big Wins. So let’s dig into tactics for improving your credit, which is quantifiably worth much more than any advice about frugality.
    - **1. Get rewarded for your spending**
- One of the biggest problems with credit cards is the hidden cost of using them. It may be incredibly convenient to swipe your card at every
  retailer, but if you don’t pay your bill every month, you’ll end up owing way more than you realize.
- How do you choose the right credit card? I have a few simple rules that I use when choosing my own cards: ■ Don’t accept credit card offers that
  come in the mail or from retail stores like Gap or Nordstrom. ■ Squeeze every reward you can out of your credit cards. ■ Pick a good one, then move
  on with your life.
- Get rewarded for your spending. There are different levels of rewards cards. Some are very basic, while others offer hundreds of dollars in annual
  benefits— or even thousands, depending on how much you spend. First, decide what you want to get rewarded with— cash back or travel. I recommend
  cash back because it’s straightforward, there are excellent cash back cards, and it’s simpler than travel rewards, which require more sophistication
  to truly maximize. (For more on maximizing travel rewards, look up forums on “credit card churning.”) Once you decide on the primary reward you
  want, use a site like bankrate.com to sort through your options.
- Most of the best rewards cards have fees. Are they worth it? You should run the numbers to decide, which takes less than 5 minutes. Here’s a quick
  rule of thumb: If you spend thousands per month on your credit card, the rewards are usually worth it. But if you spend more modestly or you’re not
  sure whether you want to pay a fee, spend a few minutes doing a quick analysis by searching for “credit card rewards calculator.”
- This person just opened one of the most predatory cards out there to save $ 4. Jesus. You might as well reach into a dirty gutter to find a few
  pennies. That would be cheaper than the financial beating you’re going to eventually take.
    - **Don’t sign up for retail store credit cards.**
- Why would you sign up for a retail store card that has high fees, near-extortionate interest rates, and terrible rewards?
- A secret of the credit card industry: When you compare credit cards online, you’re entering a murky world of SEO and affiliate fees where nearly all
  credit card listings are compensated.
- Don’t go card crazy. Now that you’re in the market, you might be tempted by any number of card offers. But don’t overdo it.
- each additional card you get means added complexity for your personal finance system: more to keep track of and more places for things to go wrong.
  Two or three is a good rule of thumb. (The average American has four credit cards.)
- My online business profile didn’t have my latest address so I never received statements. For 34 months, my bank account got charged $ 60.
- I ended up paying ~ $ 2,000 for a $ 3,000 initial balance. It completely smoked my confidence. I closed down all 11 of my cards except my CSP.
  Technically I’m still “ahead” but the thought of having paid $ 2,000 when I *didn’t have to* and it was *100% avoidable and in my control* was too
  much.
- there are other sources of credit besides credit cards. These include installment loans (such as auto loans), personal lines of credit, home equity
  lines of credit, and service credit (such as utilities).
- cautioning against prescribing a specific number of credit sources. “It depends on how long you’ve been managing credit. The less information in
  your credit report, the higher the prominence of each new report.
- In short, pick two or three great cards, maximize rewards sensibly, and remember that these cards are just one part of your overall financial
  infrastructure.
- Years ago, I decided to optimize my credit card rewards. I knew I was about 95 percent of the way there— I had cash back and travel cards for my
  business and personal spending— but I wanted to get truly dialed in for that last 5 percent. As my business had grown to dozens of employees, my
  spending had increased considerably. These rewards started to become meaningful and I wanted to be sure I was getting every benefit available. For
  example, at a certain point, we were spending over $ 40,000 on ads every month. I know most people don’t need to maximize points at this level. But
  I think it’s fascinating, and I want to share what I learned.
- ■ Am I squeezing out every possible reward from my spending? ■ How should I handle large spending events, like a wedding or a team retreat? ■ When
  should I use a cash back card versus a travel card?
    - **ask an expert who could audit my spending and give me feedback on the cards I was using.**
- guys like you and me don’t have a lot of time to play the credit card games of opening and closing cards all the time.”
- Some hotels will give you five hundred points for every night you waive housekeeping. So if I’m traveling alone, I get a room with two beds. I
  switch beds, switch towels, and I get my five hundred points.
- Chris Hutchins is the CEO of Grove (hellogrove.com), a financial planning service geared toward young professionals.
- If you’re booking travel or eating out, use a travel card to maximize rewards. For everything else, use a cash back card.
- The card I use for travel and eating out is the Chase Sapphire Reserve. For everything else, I use an Alliant cash back card. And for business, I
  use a Capital One cash back business card. For extra benefits, I have an Amex Platinum card.
    - **Ramit Sethi's credit card**
- first, we’ll set up automatic credit card payments so you never miss a payment again. Then, we’ll see how to cut fees, get better rewards, and take
  everything you can from the credit card companies.
    - **1. Pay off your credit card regularly.**
-
    1. Pay off your credit card regularly.
- your debt payment history represents 35 percent of your credit score— the largest chunk. In fact, the single most important thing you can do to
  improve your credit is to pay your bills on time.
- Today, most people pay their credit card bills online, but if you haven’t set up automatic payment yet, log on to your credit card’s website to do
  so now.
- You’ll get a statement from your card company each month before the payment goes through so that you can adjust your payment as needed.
- Awful Consequences If you miss even one payment on your credit card, here are four terrible, horrible, no good, very bad results you may face: 1.
  Your credit score can drop more than 100 points, which would add $ 227/ month to an average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. 2. Your APR can go up to 30
  percent. 3. You’ll be charged a late fee, usually around $ 35. 4. Your late payment can trigger rate increases on your other credit cards as well,
  even if you’ve never been late on them.
-
    2. Try to get fees on your cards waived. This can be a great way to optimize your credit cards, because your credit card companies will do all the
       work for you. Call them using the phone number on the back of the card and ask if you’re paying any fees, including annual fees or service
       charges.
- You: Hi, I’d like to confirm that I’m not paying any fees on my credit card. Credit card rep: Well, it looks like you have an annual fee of $ 100.
  That’s actually one of our better rates. You: I’d rather pay no fees. Can you waive this year’s annual fee?
- Earlier I mentioned that it can be worth paying annual fees for rewards cards. This is true— but why not ask? Remember, credit card companies
  compete ferociously with each other, which can benefit you. Call them a month before your new annual fee kicks in and ask them to waive it.
- If you decide that your credit card fee isn’t worth it, ask your credit card company what they’ll do for you. If they waive your fees, great! If
  not, switch to a no-fee card. I suggest you do this at the same credit card company to simplify your life—
-
    3. Negotiate a lower APR. Your APR, or annual percentage rate, is the interest rate your credit card company charges you. APRs fluctuate, but in
       general, they hover around 13 to 16 percent.
- call your credit card company and ask them to lower your APR. If they ask why, tell them you’ve been paying your bill in full on time for the last
  few months, and you know there are a number of credit cards offering better rates than you’re currently getting.
- APR doesn’t technically matter if you’re paying your bills in full every month— you could have a 2 percent APR or 80 percent APR and it would be
  irrelevant, since you don’t pay interest if you pay your total bill each month.
-
    4. Keep your main cards for a long time, and keep them active— but also keep them simple. Lenders like to see a long history of credit, which
       means that the longer you hold an account, the more valuable it is for your credit score.
- Don’t get suckered by introductory offers and low APRs— if you’re happy with your card, keep it. Some credit card companies will cancel your account
  after a certain period of inactivity. To avoid having a card you rarely use shut down, set up an automatic payment on it.
- Play it safe: If you have a credit card, keep it active using an automatic payment at least once every three months.
- Some of my readers have opened over twenty-plus cards to “churn” rewards, and now they can’t keep track of all their cards. This is where you have
  to make a decision on risk versus reward and simplicity versus complexity.
- You: Hi, I noticed I missed a payment, and I wanted to confirm that this won’t affect my credit score. Credit card rep: Let me check on that. No,
  the late fee will be applied, but it won’t affect your credit score. (Note: If you pay within a few days of your missed bill, it usually won’t be
  reported to the credit agencies. But ask to be sure.) You: Thank you! I’m really happy to hear that. Now, about that fee... I understand I was late,
  but I’d like to have it waived. Credit card rep: Why? You: It was a mistake. It won’t happen again, so I’d like to have the fee removed. (Note:
  Always end your sentence with strength. Don’t say, “Can you remove this?” Say, “I’d like to have this removed.”) At this point, you have a
  better-than-50-percent chance of getting the fee credited to your account.
- in case you get an especially tough rep, try this. Credit card rep: I’m very sorry, but we can’t refund that fee. I can try to get you our latest
  blah blah marketing pitch blah blah... You: I’m sorry, but I’ve been a customer for four years and I’d hate for this one fee to drive me away from
  your service. What can you do to remove the late fee? Credit card rep: Hmm... Let me check on that... Yes, I was able to remove the fee this time.
  It’s been credited to your account.
-
    5. Get more credit. (Warning! Do this only if you have no debt.) This one is counterintuitive,

    - **This tip is only for the financially responsible people.**
- This tip is only for people who have no credit card debt and pay their bills in full each month. It’s not for anyone else.
- It involves getting more credit to improve something called your credit utilization rate, which is simply how much you owe divided by your available
  credit.
- Lower is preferred because lenders don’t want you regularly spending all the money you have available through credit—
- To improve your credit utilization rate, you have two choices: Stop carrying so much debt on your credit cards (even if you pay it off each month)
  or increase your total available credit.
- You: Hi, I’d like to request a credit increase. I currently have five thousand dollars available, and I’d like ten thousand. Credit card rep: Why
  are you requesting a credit increase? You: I’ve been paying my bill in full for the last eighteen months and I have some upcoming purchases. I’d
  like a credit limit of ten thousand dollars. Can you approve my request? Rep: Sure. I’ve put in a request for this increase. It should be activated
  in about seven days.
- I request a credit-limit increase every six to twelve months. Remember, 30 percent of your credit score is represented by your credit utilization
  rate.
- got credit cards with reasonable limits ($ 500). Sure, I had no income, but that didn’t seem important at the time. Wouldn’t you know it, I was
  responsible enough to have my limit raised to $ 2,000 after a very short period of time! Except that I wasn’t actually responsible, and I paid
  thousands of dollars in interest and late fees and wrecked my credit rating for several years. It took many years for us to clear up this debt.
-
    6. Use your credit card’s secret perks! Before I get into rewards programs, let me say this: Just like with car insurance, you can get great deals
       on your credit when you’re a responsible customer.
- you should call your credit cards and lenders once a year to ask them what advantages you’re eligible for. Often, they can waive fees, extend
  credit, and give you private promotions that others don’t have access to.
- “Hi there. I checked my credit and noticed that I have a 750 credit score, which is pretty good. I’ve been a customer of yours for the last four
  years, so I’m wondering what special promotions and offers you have for me... I’m thinking of fee waivers and special offers that you use for
  customer retention.”
- rewards programs that give you cash back, airline tickets, and other benefits, but most people don’t take advantage of all the free stuff they can
  get.
- Did you know that credit cards automatically give you amazing consumer protection?
    - **1. Automatic warranty doubling**
- Automatic warranty doubling: Most cards extend the warranty on your purchases. So if you buy an iPhone and it breaks after Apple’s warranty expires,
  your credit card will still cover it up to an additional year. This is true for nearly every credit card for nearly every purchase, automatically.
- Car rental insurance: If you rent a car, don’t let them sell you on getting the extra collision insurance.
- Trip-cancellation insurance: If you book tickets for a vacation and then get sick and can’t travel, your airline will charge you hefty fees to
  rebook your ticket. Just call your credit card and ask for the trip-cancellation insurance to kick in, and they’ll cover those change fees— usually
  between $ 3,000 to $ 10,000 per trip.
- Concierge services: When I couldn’t find LA Philharmonic tickets, I called my credit card and asked the concierge to try to find some. He called me
  back in two days with tickets. They charged me (a lot, actually),
- Most important, your credit card automatically tracks your spending, making it easy for software to download and categorize your expenses.
- Your key takeaway: Call your credit card company and ask them to send you a full list of all their rewards. Then use them!
- We paid for our entire 3-week honeymoon using points, including first-class, round-trip direct flights from NYC to Vegas, luxury suite at the
  Venetian, luxury car rental and all other accommodations, attractions, and food
    - **Blackjack credit card**
- keeping track of every call to your financial institutions, including credit card companies, banks, and investment companies. When I call to dispute
  anything, I open a spreadsheet that details the last time I called them, who I spoke with, and what was resolved.
- The Pocket Tracker for Tracking Credit Card Calls Call Date Time Name of Rep Rep’s ID# Comments
    - **Table to track calls**
- Most credit card reps you talk to will simply give in because they know you came to play in the big leagues. When you use this to confront a credit
  card company or bank with data from your last calls, you’ll be more prepared than 99 percent of other people— and chances are, you’ll get what you
  want.
    - **Most credit card reps you talk to will simply give in**
- Think ahead before closing accounts. If you’re applying for a major loan— for a car, home, or education— don’t close any accounts within six months
  of filing the loan application. You want as much credit as possible when you apply.
- Many people don’t know that credit cards offer excellent consumer protection. This is one reason I encourage everyone to make major purchases on
  their credit card (and not use cash or a debit card).
- When I told them about my experience with the cell phone company, they instantly gave me a temporary credit for the amount and told me to mail in a
  form with my complaint, which I did. Two weeks later, the complaint was resolved in my favor.
- What happens in disputes like this is the credit card company fights the merchant for you. This works with all credit cards. Keep this in mind for
  future purchases that go wrong.
- Manage debt to avoid damaging your credit score.
- Don’t play the zero percent transfer game.
- they borrow money from the card at this low rate and stick it in a high-interest savings account, which allows them to profit off the interest. Some
  actually invest the money in short-term CDs or even stocks. At the end, they plan to return the money and keep the interest. I find these zero
  percent credit card games to be a huge waste of time. Sure, you can make a few bucks a year, or maybe even a few hundred, but the time, risk of
  mismanaging the process, and possibility of screwing up your credit score just aren’t worth it. Most important, this is a distraction that gets you
  only short-term results. You’re much better off building a personal finance infrastructure that focuses on long-term growth, not on getting a few
  bucks here or there.
- “I’m one of those rate chasers, so [with $ 40,000 in emergency savings] I’ve consistently been earning anywhere between 0.65 and 0.85 percent higher
  than my operating money market account... That’s an extra $ 300/ year in interest, which is definitely worth changing banks every four to six months
  for me.”
    - **Don't do this**
- I bet you’re smart enough to spend your time doing something better than earning $ 300/ year— something that will let you earn much more
  sustainably. You’re only earning $ 0.82/ day doing that! How about spending the same time optimizing your asset allocation? (See Asset Allocation)
  That step alone is probably worth thousands per year.
- Focus on the Big Wins to get the big results. They may not be as obvious or sexy as jumping from account to account and getting a few extra bucks,
  but the Big Wins will make you rich over the long term.
- Some people differentiate debts by calling them “good debt” and “bad debt,” depending on if the debt appreciates (education) or depreciates (car)
  over time.
- I can give you all the information on earth about credit, but until you master your money psychology, none of it makes a difference.
- Dr. Brad Klontz (yourmentalwealth.com), a professor in financial psychology, coined the term “invisible money scripts” to describe “typically
  unconscious, trans-generational beliefs about money” that are developed in childhood and drive your behavior today.
- Credit Card and Debt Scripts
- “It’s not so bad. Everyone has credit card debt. At least I don’t have as much debt as Michelle.”
    - **Don't do this**
- “I probably shouldn’t buy this, but $ 100 is just a drop in the bucket compared to how much I owe. Oh well...”
    - **Don't do this**
- “Paying interest is just like any other fee.”
    - **Don't do this**
- “These credit card companies just try to trap you.”
    - **Don't do this**
- Yes, credit card companies do want you to pay lots of fees— but it’s also your responsibility for making the decisions that got you into debt in the
  first place. Until you take responsibility, the credit card companies will be a convenient enemy.
- “I don’t even know how much I owe.”
    - **Don't do this**
- there is power in acknowledging the problem and making a plan.
- These invisible money scripts turn into very peculiar behaviors. People “know” they’re not handling their money the right way, but they continue
  doing what they’ve done for years on end.
- But I have no sympathy for people who complain without a plan. And a plan means that if you’re in debt, you should know how much you owe and the
  exact day your debt will be paid off. Almost nobody does. A plan turns debt from a “hot” emotional topic to a “cool” math problem. As I say in the
  business class I teach, “It’s not magic, it’s math.” Same for building a business, same for paying off debt.
- Most of all, a plan gives you control. It might take you three months to pay off your debt. It might be ten years! But once you have a plan, and you
  use the rest of this book to automate your plan, you’ll know you’re on track to live a Rich Life.
- However, even if you have huge student debt, I want you to pay attention to how much money you’re putting toward the monthly payments. Because the
  loan amounts are so large, even an extra $ 100/ month can save you years of payments.
- Finally, if you find that, no matter how you run the numbers, you’re not going to be able to pay your loan off in any reasonable amount of time,
  it’s time to call your lender. Look at the phone number on that monthly bill you keep ignoring. Call them up and ask them for their advice. I can’t
  emphasize this enough: Call them.
- You’ll want to ask them the following: ■ “ What would happen if I paid $ 100 more per month?” (Substitute in the right amount for you.) ■ “ What
  would happen if I changed the timeline of the loan from five years to fifteen years?” ■ If you’re looking for a job, you might ask, “What if I’m
  looking for a job and can’t afford to pay for the next three months?”
- Your lender has answers to all these questions— and chances are they can help you find a better way to structure your payment.
- the S& P 500 has returned an average of 8%, including inflation. And you can invest directly in the market with index funds.”
- credit card debt is almost always manageable if you have a plan and take disciplined steps to reduce it.
- they fall victim to the credit card companies’ nefarious practices, which prey on the uninformed— and the undisciplined.
- The key to using credit cards effectively is to pay off your credit card in full every month.
- The interest on my debt crushed me. Just because you have room on the card doesn’t mean you have room in your budget!!!!
- Debt was something I had got “used to”— my lifestyle was short-term and reactive rather than planned. I was so used to living paycheck to paycheck,
  I hadn’t experienced the freedom of being able to make conscious financial choices. Now money is a tool, not my slave master.
- Pay Your Debt Off Aggressively If you’ve found yourself in credit card debt— whether it’s a lot or a little— you have a triple whammy working
  against you: ■ First, you’re paying tons of high interest on the balance you’re carrying. ■ Second, your credit score suffers— 30 percent of your
  credit score is based on how much debt you have— putting you into a downward spiral of trying to get credit to get a house, car, or apartment and
  having to pay even more because of your poor credit. ■ Third, and potentially most damaging, debt can affect you emotionally. It can overwhelm you,
  leading you to avoid opening your bills, causing more late payments and more debt, in a vicious circle of doom. It’s time to make sacrifices to pay
  off your debt quickly. Otherwise, you’re costing yourself more and more every day.
- Managing your money has to be a priority if you ever want to be in a better situation than you are in today.
- This shows why you should always pay more than the minimum on your credit card. There’s also an added benefit to doing that: It fits in beautifully
  to your automation system, explained in Chapter 5.
- Even a tiny increase in how much you pay every month can dramatically shorten your time to being debt free. If you set up automatic payments (which
  I discuss here) and work your debt down, you won’t pay fees anymore. You won’t pay finance charges. You’ll be free to grow your money by looking
  ahead.
- This is a fixed amount. As your balance decreases, you continue to pay the fixed amount, which speeds your debt payoff, costing you less.
- Five Steps to Getting Rid of Credit Card Debt
    - **1. Figure out how much debt you have.**
- You can’t make a plan to pay off your debt until you know exactly how much you owe.
- How Much Do You Owe? Name of credit card Total amount of debt APR Minimum monthly payment
- Different cards charge you different interest rates, which can affect what you decide to pay off first.
- Prioritizing Your Debt Snowball method: lowest balance first Standard method: highest APR first
- This is all about psychology and small wins.
- pay off the credit card that’s costing you the most first.
- You: Hi. I’m going to be paying off my credit card debt more aggressively beginning next week, and I’d like a lower APR. Credit card rep: Uh, why?
  You: I’ve decided to be more aggressive about paying off my debt, and that’s why I’d like a lower APR. Other cards are offering me rates at half of
  what you’re offering. Can you lower my rate by 50 percent, or only 40 percent? Credit card rep: Hmm... After reviewing your account, I’m afraid we
  can’t offer you a lower APR. We can offer you a credit limit increase, however. You: No, that won’t work for me. Like I mentioned, other credit
  cards are offering me zero percent introductory rates for twelve months, as well as APRs of half what you’re offering. I’ve been a customer for X
  years, and I’d prefer not to switch my balance over to a low-interest card. Can you match the other credit card rates, or can you go lower? Credit
  card rep: I see... Hmm, let me pull something up here. Fortunately, the system is suddenly letting me offer you a reduced APR. That is effective
  immediately.
- Decide where the money to pay off your credit cards will come from.
    - **Ways:**
- Balance transfers. Many people begin by considering a balance transfer to a card with a lower APR. I’m not a fan of these. Yes, it can help for a
  few months and save you some money, particularly on large balances.
- As we just discussed, a better option is to call and negotiate the APR down on your current accounts.
- Taking money from a 401( k) or home equity line of credit (heloc). I don’t recommend either of these options.
- People with credit card debt often find it difficult to reduce spending and end up getting back into debt after tapping their 401( k) or HELOC. If
  you use your HELOC money to pay off credit cards, you’ll risk losing your home if you run up more debt.
- Reducing spending and prioritizing debt. The most sustainable way to pay off credit card debt
- They just have to stop spending on random items, get conscious about making debt a priority, and set up aggressive automatic transfers to pay off
  their credit card debt.
- Pay special attention to these discussions: ■ “ The Next $ 100” concept here. ■ Figuring out how much you can afford to put toward your debt using
  the Conscious Spending Plan. ■ The “Save $ 1,000 in 30 Days” Challenge. ■ Setting up automatic payments. ■ My bonus resources at

- Remember the philosophy behind the 85 Percent Solution: The goal is not to research every last corner to decide where the money will come from; it’s
  action.
- Figure out how much debt you have, decide how you want to pay it down, negotiate your rates, and get started.

- call and make sure it’s a no-fee card.
- Set up automatic payments so your credit card bill is paid off in full every month.
- Apply for more credit, if you’re debt-free.
- start paying it off
- figure out how much you owe, call the lender to negotiate down the APR or restructure your payments
- You’ve waived your card fees, negotiated your rates down, and even set up automatic payments. And if you have debt, you’ve taken the first steps
  toward paying it all off.

## Beat the Banks

- Open high-interest, low-hassle accounts and negotiate fees like an Indian
- pick the best bank and the best accounts so you can earn the maximum amount of interest.
- Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos once said this: “If you do build a great experience, customers tell each other about that. Word of mouth is very powerful.”
- I hate banks as a matter of practice. I find them scammy, dishonest, and selective with their information. Their “advice” is always what’s in their
  best interest, not the customer’s.
- Just look at the banks’ past behavior. The good ones simply offer better services and no fees. The bad ones offer ever-increasing fees and
  unnecessary products, and devise even more ingenious ways to screw you out of your money.
- Wells Fargo committed fraud
- TIAA used to be a trustworthy investment firm—
- Schwab rolled out a phenomenal high-interest checking account years ago that offered unrivaled benefits for free.
- Vanguard has consistently demonstrated a long-term focus on low costs and putting their clients first.
- Not only do they levy fee after fee, they launch marketing campaigns to trick customers into signing up for services they don’t need and which, if
  they understood the terms, they would never agree to.
- For example, if you deposit $ 1,000, a Big Bank pays you a small amount in interest to hold on to that money, then turns around and lends it out at
  a much higher percent for a home loan.
- For example, if you’re using a debit card and accidentally buy something for more money than you have in your checking account, you’d expect your
  bank to decline the charge, right? Nope. They let the transaction go through, and then helpfully charge you around $ 30 for an overdraft fee.
- she could have negotiated her way out of the first few fees and then set up a system so that it never happened again.
- On your recommendation, I moved to Schwab. I’ve used them all over the world (including in Pakistan at what claims to be the world’s highest ATM).
- Invisible money script
- The banks I recommend are more convenient, cheaper, and offer better rewards than Big Banks. As you grow your income, you’ll know you’re working
  with the best.
- Your checking account is the backbone of your financial system. It’s where your money will first go before it’s “filtered” to different parts of
  your system, like your savings account, your investing account, and your guilt-free spending.
- All my money goes in my checking account, and then I regularly apportion it out to appropriate accounts, like savings and investing, using automatic
  transfers.
- I pay most of my bills through my credit card, but the bills that I can’t pay with my card— like rent or my car payment— I pay directly from my
  checking account using automatic transfers.
- Checking accounts are the number one place where unnecessary fees are levied, and we’re going to fix that.
- Think of savings accounts as places for short-term (one month) to mid-term savings (five years). You want to use your savings account to save up for
  things like vacations and holiday gifts, or even longer-term items, like a wedding or the down payment on a house. The key difference between
  checking and savings accounts is this: Savings accounts technically pay more interest. I say “technically” because on a practical level, the
  interest on your savings account is essentially meaningless.
- Second, I failed to explain why the interest rate on your savings account is not all that important.
- (Interestingly, if we’re getting technical, many people lose money every day their money is in savings, since inflation erodes the real purchasing
  power of your cash. That’s why the bulk of your wealth will be made from investing,
- If you learn only one thing from this book, it should be to turn your attention from the micro to the macro.
- the amount I earn from one year of investing is worth more than 500 years of interest in a savings account.
- Checking accounts are built for frequent withdrawals: They have debit cards and ATMs for your convenience. But your savings account is really a
  “goals” account, where every dollar is assigned to a specific item you’re saving up for, like a house, a vacation, or an emergency fund.
- Surprisingly, I recommend two different accounts at two separate banks. Here’s why: Having your money in two separate accounts— and banks— uses
  psychology to keep your savings growing. One basic way of looking at it is that your savings account is where you deposit money, whereas your
  checking account is where you withdraw money.
- If you don’t have the money available in your discretionary (checking) account because you’ve spent your “going out” money, you’ll know it. Having a
  separate savings account forces you to keep your long-term goals in mind instead of just blowing them off to have a few rounds of drinks.
- But I was wrong— no matter how much money I made, if I didn’t have a plan, I would always feel like I had insufficient money.
- One guy told me that his amounts were so small, it didn’t really matter. To me, that’s the perfect time to start: when the stakes are low.
- right accounts, with automatic saving and investing—
- You want to pick accounts that work well with your personality. You have to know yourself: Do you value simplicity? Or are you the kind of person
  who wants to spend your time building a complicated system for a slightly larger payout?
- Most basic option (good for lazy people):
- A checking account and a savings account at any local bank.
- Basic option + small optimization (recommended for most people):
- This option means opening accounts at two separate institutions: a no-fee checking account at your local bank and a high-yield online savings
  account.
- Advanced setup + full optimization (perfect for people who read things like Lifehacker and The 4-Hour Workweek):
- This setup consists of maintaining several checking accounts and savings accounts at different banks, usually to eke out the most interest and
  services that various banks have to offer.
- How My Bank Accounts Work
- Generally, I use my Capital One 360 account as a receiver, not a sender: I rarely transfer money out of there unless I need to cover a temporary
  shortage in my checking account or want to spend savings money on something important, like a vacation
    - **Capital One 360 account is savings account**
- Most traditional banks offer different checking and savings accounts to serve customers with different needs and amounts of money.
- Next, they offer accounts that have nominal monthly fees. They also offer ways for you to get these fees waived, like using direct deposit (where
  your paycheck is automatically sent to your bank every month) or maintaining a minimum balance.
- Finally, banks offer higher-end accounts with higher minimums— often $ 5,000 or $ 10,000— and more services, like commission-free brokerage trades (
  which you should avoid, since banks are the last place you should invest), “bonus” interest rates, and discounts on home loans. These accounts are
  worthless. Avoid them.
    - **Don't do this**
- Beyond just the type of accounts offered, there’s more to consider when choosing your bank( s). I look for three things: trust, convenience, and
  features.
- Credit unions are like local banks, but they’re not-for-profit and are owned by their customers (or, in credit union parlance, “members”).
- Credit unions squandered a generational opportunity to position themselves against predatory and scammy banks like Bank of America and Wells Fargo.
    - **Translation: Credit union浪费了一代人的机会来对抗美国银行和富国银行等掠夺性和欺诈性银行。**
- Within about five minutes, you should be able to tell which banks are trustworthy and which are not by seeing how straightforward they are with
  their accounts and fees.
- It should have a website with clear descriptions of different services, an easy setup process, and 24/ 7 customer service available by phone.
  Another thing: Ask them if they send you promotional material every damn week.
- Marketing Tactics Banks Use to Trick You
- Teaser rates
    - **Don't do this**
- You want to pick a good bank that you can stick with for years— one that offers overall great service,
- Requiring minimum balances to get “free” services
    - **Don't do this**
- Most of these “value-added accounts” are designed to charge you for worthless services.
- Holding out by telling you that the no-fee, no-minimum accounts aren’t available anymore.
    - **Don't do this**
- If you didn’t walk in specifically wanting the bank credit card, don’t get it.
- Since a bank is the first line of defense in managing your money, it needs to be easy to put money in, get money out, and transfer money around.
  This means its website has to work, and you need to be able to get help when you need it—
- The bank’s interest rate should be competitive. Transferring money around should be easy and free, because you’ll be doing a lot of it, and you
  should have free bill paying. Their app or website should be something you enjoy using.
- If your bank account offers one rate and another bank starts offering a slightly higher rate, don’t change accounts. Half the time, those rates are
  simply introductory teaser rates that will drop after six months.
- That’s a colossal waste of time for most of us, since a 0.5 percent difference equals just a few dollars per month more in interest. Plus, interest
  rates change over time, so rate chasing doesn’t even make sense.
- The Best Accounts
- Schwab Bank Investor Checking with Schwab One Brokerage Account (schwab.com/ banking):
- Schwab offers a stunningly good account with no fees, no minimums, no-fee overdraft protection, free bill pay, free checks, an ATM card, automatic
  transfers, and— best of all— unlimited reimbursement of any ATM usage. That means you can withdraw from any ATM and you’ll pay no fees.
- Although you need to open a Schwab brokerage (investment) account to get all fees waived, you don’t actually need to use the investment account.
- (In my case, I rarely use cash and when I do, I’m withdrawing it, not depositing it.
- Online savings accounts let you earn more interest with lower hassle. And because you’ll be primarily sending money there, not withdrawing it, what
  does it matter if it takes three days to get your money?
- Capital One 360 Savings (capitalone.com/ bank):
- It lets you create virtual sub-savings accounts,
- You can also set up automatic transfers to other accounts
- There are no fees, no minimums, and no tricky up-sells or annoying promotions.
- Ally Online Savings Account (ally.com/ bank):
- Marcus by Goldman Sachs and American Express Personal Savings.
- Banks to consider
    - **Only available in US**
- I recommend you keep your old account open with a small amount of money in it in case you have any automatic transfers that are still trying to draw
  from your old account. Set a 60-day calendar reminder to close the old account.
- This means you shouldn’t be paying fees or minimums. The key to optimizing an account is talking to an actual customer service rep, either in person
  or on the phone.
- This is why I’m fanatical about my savings and checking accounts having no fees of any kind, including monthly fees, overdraft fees, or setup fees.
- Certain charges are okay— for example, when it comes to services like money orders and reordering checks.
- You: Hi. I noticed that my current checking account has fees. I’d like my account to have no annual fees, free checking, and no minimum balance,
  please. Bank rep: I’m really sorry, but we don’t offer that kind of account anymore. You: Really? That’s interesting, because [competitor] is
  offering me that exact deal right now. Could you check again and tell me which comparable accounts you offer? (Eighty percent of the time, you’ll
  get a great account at this point. If not, ask for a supervisor.) Supervisor: Hi, how can I help you? You: (Repeat argument from the beginning. If
  the supervisor doesn’t give you an option, add this:) Look, I’ve been a customer for X years, and I want to find a way to make this work. Plus, I
  know that your customer-acquisition cost runs hundreds of dollars. What can you do to help me stay a customer? Supervisor: What an astounding
  coincidence. My computer is suddenly allowing me to offer the exact account you asked for!
- The bank has already spent a lot of money to land you as a customer and doesn’t want to lose you over something as small as a $ 5 monthly fee.
- Set up automatic transfers and keep a cash cushion in your account (I keep about $ 1,000 in my checking at all times).
- Remember: They want to keep you as their customer. A well-executed phone call can often make a difference.
- Bad things to say here:
    - **Don't do this**
- Try this instead: Ramit: Well, I see the fee here, and I’d really like to get it waived. What else can you do to help me? (Repeat your complaint and
  ask them how to constructively fix it.) At this point, about 85 percent of people will get their fees refunded. I have hundreds of comments from
  people on my blog who have taken this advice and saved thousands of dollars in fees. But in case the rep is obstinate, here’s what you can do. Bank
  rep: I’m sorry, sir, we can’t refund that fee. Ramit: I understand it’s difficult, but take a look at my history. I’ve been a customer for more than
  three years, and I’d like to keep the relationship going. Now, I’d like to get this waived— it was a mistake, and it won’t happen again. What can
  you do to help? Bank rep: Hmm, one second, please. I see that you’re a really good customer... I’m going to check with my supervisor. Can you hold
  for a second? (Being a long-term customer increases your value to them, which is one reason you want to pick a bank you can stick with for the long
  term. And the fact that you didn’t back down at the first “no” makes you different from 99 percent of other customers.) Bank rep: Sir, I was able to
  check with my supervisor and waive the fee. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
- She just asked them if they would waive the ATM fees while she was there.
- Remember, with a customer-acquisition cost of more than $ 100, banks want to keep you as their customer. So use this information to your advantage
  and make the call next time you see any fees levied on your account.
- While many bank fees are ridiculous, I find that they are quite willing to wipe them for a good customer.

    - **1 Open a checking account or assess the one you already have (one hour).**
- 1 Open a checking account or assess the one you already have (one hour).
- “I’d like to confirm that my bank account has no fees and no minimums whatsoever. Can you confirm that?”
- Be aggressive in threatening to leave if they don’t switch you.
- You’ll earn higher interest, and it’s psychologically powerful to have your savings account separate from your checking: You’ll be much less likely
  to dip into your savings if it's not immediately reachable through your normal banking.
- 2a Optional: Open an online checking account (two hours).
- Remember, the main benefits of an online checking account are a high interest rate and fewer tricky fees.
- Leave one and a half months of living expenses in your checking account, or as close to it as you can manage.

## Get Ready to Invest

- Open your 401( k) and Roth IRA— even with just $ 50
- Michael Batnick, author of Big Mistakes: The Best Investors and Their Worst Investments, writes: “The median retirement balance in the United States
  for people ages 56– 61 is $ 25,000. This could have been accomplished by investing $ 6 a month since 1980 into a 60/ 40 portfolio.”
- Get a life. The sad fact is, if you do only the bare minimum— for example, if you get frugal and save $ 100 a month in an online savings account—
  the results will not be especially impressive. Even if you’re earning a solid rate in a high-interest savings account, it will take you a long, long
  time to get a substantial return.
- Put simply, saving is not enough. You need a way to put that money to work for you so it earns more than even the highest-yielding savings account,
  and investing is the first and best way to do it.
- “Compounding,” Albert Einstein said, “is mankind’s greatest invention because it allows for the reliable, systematic accumulation of wealth.”
- Over the twentieth century, the average annual stock market return was 11 percent, minus 3 percent for inflation, giving us 8 percent.
- when you’re ready, you can simply “turn on” automatic transfers to funnel cash there each month.
- INVESTING ISN’T ABOUT PICKING STOCKS.
- Another reason people don’t invest is that they’re scared of losing money.
- (Long-term investors should love when the market drops: You can buy more shares for the same price.)
- Invisible script
- “I haven’t invested in anything because there are so many different options to put my money in over the long term (real estate, stocks, crypto,
  commodities, etc.). I know I should invest but stocks don’t ‘feel’ controllable.”
- Data clearly indicates that the average investor buys high, sells low, and trades frequently (which incurs taxes), and all of this cuts their
  returns by huge amounts.
- “Fees are a big part of it. When you only have a small amount to invest, trading fees can make a big dent in your returns.”
- It is totally mystifying how people think “investing = trading stocks.” Oh wait, no it isn’t— every stupid commercial and app pushes this agenda.
  When you follow my advice, your investment fees are extremely low.
- We all have lots of reasons why we aren’t doing something we “should,” like investing, flossing, or starting a business. No time, no money, not sure
  where to start, etc. Sometimes the truth is simpler: We just don’t want to.
- Of America’s millionaires, two-thirds are self-made, meaning their parents weren’t rich. They collected their significant wealth through controlling
  their spending, regular investing, and, in some cases, entrepreneurship.
- “83% of the wealthy say their largest investment gains have come from smaller wins over time rather than taking big risks.” (Note: This doesn’t mean
  cutting back on coffee. It means consistent, meaningful behaviors like disciplined saving and investing, rather than massive speculative risks.)
- Their wealth isn’t measured by the amount they make each year, but by how much they’ve saved and invested over time.
    - **Compounding interest**
- The American Psychological Association reports that Americans today, compared to the 1950s, seem less happy,
- In a way, this learned helplessness can become addictive.
- Many account providers will waive minimums (the amount required to open an account) if you set up an automatic monthly transfer.
- I’ve invested $ 70,000 since reading the book, maxed out my Roth IRA, contributed 19 percent of my paycheck to my 401( k), and don’t lose a moment’s
  sleep over active trading. I set my allocation once per year, forget it, and live my life.
- I’ve been investing in my Roth IRA, 401( k), and HSA for years and finally cracked $ 100,000 in savings.
- I started off putting 8– 10 percent in my 403( b) initially and marched it up over the years. I turn 31 in August and currently have $ 135,000 in my
  403( b), $ 18,000-ish in my Roth IRA, maybe $ 12,000 in checking/ savings and $ 60,000-ish in other investments like single stocks and crypto. I am
  absolutely loving making my money for me and not being a slave to it.
- The Ladder of Personal Finance
    - **1. Credit card and other debt**
- regular non-retirement (“ taxable”) investment account
- Whether it’s starting a company or getting an additional degree, there’s often no better investment than your own career.
- It’s a “retirement” account because it gives you large tax advantages if you agree not to withdraw your money from the account until you reach the
  retirement age of 59 ½.
    - **Retirement Account's Benefits**
- Retirement accounts offer you a deal: You promise to invest your money for the long term, and in exchange, they give you huge tax advantages.
  Because the money you’re contributing isn’t taxed until you withdraw it many years later (that’s why it’s called “pre-tax money”),
    - **401(k)**
- a retirement account for long-term investments, not a checking or savings account. If you withdraw money before you’re 591/ 2 years old, you incur
  severe penalties, including income taxes and an early-withdrawal penalty of 10 percent.
    - **401(k)**
- invest your money, including lifecycle funds and index funds,
    - **IRA**
- be aggressive with how much you contribute to your 401( k), because every dollar you invest now will likely be worth many more times that in the
  future.
    - **401(k)**
- (If you’re wondering why student loan debt is okay to have while you move on to investing, here’s why: Student loan debt tends to have lower
  interest rates than credit card debt. It also tends to be large. That means you can set up a payment schedule, but also invest at the same time.)
- you can withdraw your principal (the amount you actually invested from your pocket) penalty-free.
    - **Roth IRA**
- Contributing as much as possible is almost as important as starting early.
- If you know you’ll need your money in fewer than five years, put it in a high-interest savings account.
- We’ll focus on discount brokerages like Vanguard because they charge dramatically smaller fees than full-service brokerages like Morgan Stanley.
  Full-service brokerages offer so-called “comprehensive services,” but they basically just charge you a lot of money to sell you useless research and
  let you talk to salespeople. Discount brokerages, on the other hand, let you make the choices, charge only small fees, and offer online access.
- Recommended Discount Brokerages
    - **Vanguard vanguard.com (have low fees)**
- Brokerage name Minimum to open a Roth IRA Things to know
- Minimums. Before you open your investment account, you’ll want to compare minimum required investments.
- Features. You can also investigate the features your brokerage offers, but frankly most of these are now commodities, so what used to be
  differentiators— 24/ 7 customer service, apps, easy-to-use websites— are now standard.
- As Benjamin Franklin said, “Don’t put off until tomorrow what you can do today.”
- Robo-advisors are investment firms that use computer algorithms to invest your money (“ robo” refers to a computer investing for you versus an
  expensive adviser).
- Long-term investing is a critical part of living a Rich Life, so if companies can strip away complexity and make it easier to get started— even
  charging a generally low fee— I’m a fan.
- In the case of robo-advisors, commission-based financial advisers generally hate them because they use technology to achieve what many advisers were
  doing— but cheaper.
- In order to run a sustainable business on fees lower than 0.4 percent, they have to offer new, more expensive features and manage massive amounts of
  money—
- “tax-loss harvesting”— which is basically selling an investment that’s down to offset tax gains—
- The offering uses derivatives to replicate a popular hedge fund strategy known as “risk-parity.”
- the most important choice of all: to start growing your money in long-term, low-cost investments. Whether you choose a robo-advisor or Vanguard or
  another low-fee brokerage is a minor detail. Pick one and move on.
- If you didn’t set up automatic contributions, do so now, even if it’s just $ 50/ month. It’s a good habit to get into and will help you accrue any
  necessary minimum.
- Before you get excited about investing through your HSA, you should find out if you’re even eligible.
- Have you already completed at least the first three rungs of the Ladder of Personal Finance: investing in a 401( k) match, paying off any credit
  card debt, and maxing out your Roth IRA?
- Do you have a high-deductible health plan?
- The most important factor for me was the investment options and fees: Do they have good funds with low fees?
- You get a debit card that you can use for “qualified medical expenses,” including bandages, chiropractors, eye exams and glasses, and
  prescriptions. (This is just a small handful of the health-related expenses you can pay for with your HSA card. To see them all, search for “HSA
  eligible expenses.”)
- The real benefit of an HSA comes when you treat it as an investment vehicle.
- You invest $ 3,000 pre-tax in an HSA. Here’s the beautiful part: You don’t pay taxes on the money when you earn it— and you don’t pay taxes on the
  investment earnings!
- Here are the things to be aware
- Finally, some people see HSAs as such a good deal that they pay for as many medical expenses as possible out of pocket, since they prefer to let
  their HSA investments grow.
    - **Translation: 宁愿自己出医药费也不要拿HSA的钱因为盈利真的很多，不用交税。**
- Contributing to an HSA tax-free and investing the money you don’t use eliminates the “drag” of taxes on your growth, which compounds faster than in
  almost any other investment account.
- Having investment accounts means you’re starting to think about rapid growth and distinguishing between short-term savings and long-term investing.

## Conscious Spending

- How to save hundreds per month (and still buy what you love)
- It turns out there is one universal shortcut to discovering someone’s true character: if they eat chicken wings like an immigrant.
- I quickly realized that the most interesting part of eating wings with friends is seeing how much meat they leave on the bone. Some people leave
  half the chicken and move on to the next wing. I never speak to these people again.
- there are people who clean the bone so thoroughly, flawlessly ridding it of every last shred of meat and marrow, that you can conclude only two
  things: They will be stellar successes in all aspects of life, and they must be from another country.
- In this chapter, the antidote to unconscious spending, we’re going to gently create a new, simple way of spending. It’s time to stop wondering where
  all your money goes each month. I’m going to help you redirect it to the places you choose, like investing, saving, and even spending more on the
  things you love (but less on the things you don’t).
- Most people wouldn’t know where to start if I told them to stop spending and start saving.
- Instead of taking a simplistic “Don’t spend money on expensive things!!!” view, I believe there’s a more nuanced approach.
- Unfortunately, most Americans were never taught how to consciously spend, which means cutting costs mercilessly on the things you don’t love, but
  spending extravagantly on the things you do. Instead, we were taught to generically apply the principle of “Don’t spend money on that!” to
  everything, meaning we try half-heartedly to cut back, fail, then guiltily berate ourselves— and continue overspending on things we don’t even care
  about.
- There is power in saying no to the things we don’t care about. But there is even more power in saying a big YES to the things we love.
- There’s also the social influence to spend. Call it the Sex and the City effect, where your friends’ spending directly affects yours.
- Conscious spending isn’t about cutting your spending on everything. That approach wouldn’t last two days. It is, quite simply, about choosing the
  things you love enough to spend extravagantly on— and then cutting costs mercilessly on the things you don’t love.
- The Millionaire Next Door discovered, 50 percent of the more than 1,000 millionaires surveyed have never paid more than $ 400 for a suit, $ 140 for
  a pair of shoes, or $ 235 for a wristwatch.
- Again, conscious spending is not about simply cutting your spending on various things. It’s about making your own decisions about what’s important
  enough to spend a lot on and what’s not, rather than blindly spending on everything.
- Cheap People vs. Conscious Spenders
- Cheap people care about the cost of something. Conscious spenders care about the value of something.
    - **Ask yourself what do you value. Spend on it.**
- Cheap people think short-term. Conscious spenders think long-term.
- Conscious spending means you decide exactly where you’re going to spend your money— for going out, for saving, for investing, for rent— and you free
  yourself from feeling guilty about your spending. Along with making you feel comfortable with your spending, a plan keeps you moving toward your
  goals instead of just treading water.
- ask yourself these questions: Have you funded your 401( k) and Roth IRA, and opened additional investment accounts? Are you fully aware of where
  your spending money is going? And have you made a strategic decision to spend on what you love?
- Instead they end up spending it on random things here and there, eventually watching their money trickle away. Just as important, have you decided
  what you don’t love?
- The biggest shift for me was my mindset, specifically related to conscious spending (spending luxuriously on my priorities, scrimping on the rest)
  and automating my finances,
- For John, the limiting factor is time. He knows he’d never send money regularly anywhere if he had to actively do it himself, so he set up his
  investment accounts to automatically withdraw money before he ever sees it. The key here is that John knows himself and has set up systems to
  support his weaknesses.
- My Rich Life is guilt-free spending. I no longer say I can’t afford X, Y, or Z. I say I choose not to spend on it.
- Kahneman found that “emotional well-being” peaks at $ 75,000. But if you take another measure, “life satisfaction,” you find no plateau— not at $
  75,000, or $ 500,000, or even $ 1 million.
- “For developing and developed countries alike, being richer is correlated with higher life satisfaction.”
- “People who spent money to buy themselves time, such as by outsourcing disliked tasks, reported greater overall life satisfaction.”
- She does this by being extremely disciplined: She cooks at home, shares rent in a small apartment, and uses all the benefits that her employer
  offers. When she’s invited out to eat, she checks her envelope system to see if she can afford it. If not, she politely declines. But when she does
  go out, she never feels guilty about spending, because she knows she can afford it.
- Use Psychology Against Yourself to Save
    - **Cancel subscriptions, use a la carte payment method.**
- Subscriptions can be anything from Netflix to cell phone plans to your cable bill. They are a business’s best friend: They let companies make a
  predictable income off you— automatically.
- The À La Carte Method takes advantage of psychology to cut our spending. Here’s how it works: Cancel all the discretionary subscriptions you can:
  your magazines, cable— even your gym. Then, buy what you need à la carte:
- The Downside of the À La Carte Method. This method requires you to de-automate your life.
- Each of them pays themselves first, whether it’s $ 500/ month or $ 2,000/ month. They’ve built an infrastructure to do this automatically so that by
  the time money ends up in their checking account, they know they can spend it guilt-free. They spend less time worrying about money than most
  people!
- it’s a big part of what I Will Teach You to Be Rich is about: automatically enabling yourself to save, invest, and spend— enjoying it, and not
  feeling guilty about those new jeans, because you’re spending only what you have. You can do it. All it takes is a plan.
- Because young people are not carefully considering their financial choices in the context of their long-term goals— we’re not paying ourselves first
  and we’re not developing an investment/ savings plan—
- The I Will Teach You to Be Rich Conscious Spending Plan
- Some readers told me this was the most challenging part of the book. But I believe it’s also the most rewarding, because you get to consciously
  choose how you want to spend your money— and therefore, how you want to live your Rich Life.
- Conscious Spending Plan involves four major buckets where your money will go: fixed costs, investments, savings, and guilt-free spending
- Categories of Spending
- Monthly Fixed Costs Fixed costs are the amounts you must pay, like your rent/ mortgage, utilities, cell phone, and student loans.
- Check out the chart below with common basic expenses (the bare minimum that any ordinary person would use to live).
- Monthly Expense Monthly Cost
- Finally, once you’ve gotten all your expenses filled in, add 15 percent for expenditures you haven’t counted yet.
- A flat 15 percent will likely cover you for things you haven’t figured in,
- (I actually have a “stupid mistakes” category in my money system. When I first started this, I saved $ 20/ month for unexpected expenses. Then,
  within two months, I had to go to the doctor for $ 600 and I got a traffic ticket for more than $ 100. That changed things quickly, and I currently
  save $ 200/ month for unexpected expenses. At the end of the year, if I haven’t spent it, I save half and I spend the other half.)
- “The 60 Percent Solution,” which suggested that you split your money into simple buckets, with the largest, basic expenses (food, bills, taxes),
  making up 60 percent of your gross income. The remaining 40 percent would be split four ways: 1. Retirement savings (10 percent) 2. Long-term
  savings (10 percent) 3. Short-term savings for irregular expenses (10 percent) 4. Fun money (10 percent)
- Savings Goals
    - **Gifts for friends and family.**
- Don’t let things like gifts surprise you. You already know the common gifts you’ll buy: holiday and birthday presents. What about anniversaries? Or
  special gifts like graduations?
- For me, a Rich Life includes preparing for predictable expenses so they don't surprise me. Planning ahead isn’t “weird,” it’s smart.
- They’ve created their own prison of frugality. You don’t want to end up like this person writing on the financial independence subreddit. “Looking
  back at the past few years of my life and at my bank account, I would gladly give away a hefty chunk of it and work longer if it meant I could have
  experienced more of the world and found more passions. I built my savings, but I never built my life.”
    - **Don't do this**
- My Tools of the Trade
    - **You Need a Budget (youneedabudget.com) or YNAB**
- To get more prescriptive about your spending, I recommend using a piece of software called You Need a Budget (youneedabudget.com) or YNAB
- Let’s take an example: Brian takes home $ 48,000 per year after taxes, or $ 4,000/ month. According to his Conscious Spending Plan, here’s how his
  spending should look:
- Good answer: Brian decides to pick his three biggest expenses and optimize them.
- Try focusing on Big Wins that will make a large, measurable change.
- Do you know people who get so obsessed with something new that they go completely overboard and burn out? I would rather do less but make it
  sustainable.
- She would rather dream about running three times a week than actually run once a week.
    - **Don't do this**
- when a person goes from one extreme to another, the behavioral change rarely lasts.
- When I make a change, I almost always make it a bite-sized one in an area that matters
- Whether you’re implementing a change in your personal finances, eating habits, exercise plan, or whatever... try making the smallest change today.
  Something you’ll hardly notice. And follow your own plan for gradually increasing it.
- Once you spend the money for that month, that’s it: You can’t spend more. If it’s really an emergency, you can dip into other envelopes—
- Build the habit first. Systematize it later.
- You can transfer from one envelope to another... but that money is coming out of another category, so your total spending doesn’t actually increase.
- What If You Don’t Make Enough Money?
    - **1. Negotiate a Raise**
- There’s a limit to how much you can cut, but no limit to how much you can earn.
- Negotiate a Raise
- Asking for a raise takes careful planning.
- Remember that getting a raise is not about you. It’s about you demonstrating your value to your employer.
- You can, however, show how your work has been contributing to the company’s success and ask to be compensated fairly.
- Three to six months before you ask for a raise, sit down with your boss and ask what it would take to be a top performer at your company. Get
  crystal clear about what you’d need to deliver. And ask how being a top performer would affect your compensation.
- Set up the meeting: Hi Boss, How are you? Hope you had a great New Year’s! I’m really excited to kick things off this year, especially with our new
  X and Y projects coming up. I really want to do an exceptional job, and I’d like to chat with you for a few minutes about how I can be a top
  performer. I have some ideas of my own, but I’d love to get your guidance as well. Would a 15-minute chat next week be okay? If so, how about I
  swing by your desk Monday morning at 10 a.m.? Thanks, Your Name
- You: Hi Boss, thanks for taking the time to meet with me. As I mentioned, I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about the position and what I can do to
  really be a top performer this year, and I’d like to discuss that with you if that’s okay. Boss: Sure. You: So the way I see it, my role in the
  position can be broken down into three main areas: A, B, and C. I think I’m doing pretty well with A, and I’m picking up B pretty rapidly. And I
  need a little help with C, as we’ve discussed before. Does that sound about right to you? Boss: Yes, that sounds right. You: I’ve been thinking a
  lot about these three areas and how I can really take them to the next level. I have some initial thoughts of my own, and I’d be happy to talk about
  those, but I’d actually like to get your thoughts first. In your eyes, what would be the most meaningful things I can do in these three areas to
  really be considered a top performer? Boss: Hm... I’m not really sure. Maybe blah, blah, and blah. You: Yeah, I agree— we’re on the same page here.
  So here’s what I was thinking: Specifically, I’d like to achieve goals A, B, and C, and I’d like to do all this in six months. That’s pretty
  aggressive, but I think it’s doable. Would you agree that’s something that you’d like to see from me, and that it would also help peg me as a top
  performer? Boss: Yes, it would. That sounds perfect. You: Okay, great. I really appreciate it, Boss. So I’ll get to work on this and keep you in the
  loop with a status update every four weeks as usual. The last thing I’d like to talk about is: If I do an extraordinary job, then at the end of the
  six months all I ask is that we sit down to discuss a possible compensation adjustment. But let’s cross that bridge when we get to it, OK? Boss:
  Sounds fine. Looking forward to seeing what you can do. You: Great. I’ll type up these notes and send them to you. Thanks again!
- Now it’s time to deliver. Start tracking everything you do at work and the results you get.
- If you can’t figure out the exact results you’re driving, ask someone at work who’s more experienced and knows how to tie your work to company
  results.
- Be sure to keep your boss in the loop so he or she knows how you’re progressing. Managers don’t love surprises; they love brief status updates
  roughly every week or two.
- Approximately two months before you ask for a raise, meet with your boss again and demonstrate your tracking from the previous month. Ask what you
  could do better. You want to know if you’re on the right track with your work, and it’s important that you regularly communicate your progress.
- One month before the big event, mention to your boss that because you’ve been doing so well, you’d like to discuss compensation at a meeting the
  next month. Ask what you’ll need to bring to make it a fruitful discussion. Listen very carefully to what he or she says.
- Around this time, it wouldn’t hurt to ask your fellow coworkers to put in a good word with the boss. This assumes, of course, that you’ve been
  exceeding expectations and driving concrete results.
- Two weeks before you ask for a raise, ask a couple of friends to role-play your job negotiation.
- And pick good friends— people who have business experience and will give you feedback on how you performed.
- “ You didn’t hit those goals.” If you genuinely didn’t hit your goals, you should have communicated that earlier and decided on a plan of action
  with your boss. But if your boss is simply using this as an excuse— to obfuscate what the goals were, or to move the goalposts— here’s your
  response: “If there are areas for me to grow, I’d love to discuss them. But on [date], you and I agreed to these goals. And I’ve sent you a weekly
  update since then. I’m all for exceeding goals— which I’ve done, as you can see from [Specific Project]— but I want to be compensated in good
  faith.”
- “ I didn’t agree to a raise.” Your response: “That is true. But as we discussed on [date], we both agreed that if I hit these goals, I’d be
  considered a top performer— and that we’d discuss a compensation adjustment in the future.” (Pull out a printout of the email chain.)
- “ We can discuss this another time.” Your response: “I understand if there’s a timeline for raises and we’re off cycle. But I’ve put six months of
  work in to hit these goals and I’ve updated you along the way. I plan to continue exceeding my goals, but I’d like to get clear that I’m on track
  for a raise on our next cycle— in writing.”
- On the day you negotiate, come in with your salary, a couple of competitive salaries from salary.com and payscale.com, and your list of
  accomplishments, and be ready to discuss fair compensation.
- You want to proceed as partners, as in “How do we make this work?” This is the culmination of all your preparation and hard work. You can do this!
- That was a huge first step toward increasing your income. If you don’t, ask your boss what you can do to excel in your career, or consider leaving
  to find another company that will give you greater room to grow.
- Get a Higher-Paying Job
- Do Freelance Work
    - **1. upwork.com**
- Babysitting is an example of freelancing (and it pays very well).
- When you embrace the idea that you can earn more, one of the biggest surprises you’ll discover is that you already possess skills others would pay
  for— and you’ve never even realized it.
- Remember, busy people want others to help them with their lives.
- So another key to having a plan you’ll use is to account for the unexpected and build in a bit of flexibility.
- Known irregular events (vehicle registration fees, Christmas gifts, vacations).
- Unknown irregular events (surprise medical expenses or traffic tickets). These types of surprises fall under your monthly fixed expenses,
- add about 15 percent to your estimate of your fixed costs to accommodate these surprises.
- Regular Irregular
- Unexpected one-time income. Sometimes money falls in your lap, like a birthday gift, a tax return, or an unexpected freelance contract.
    - **Use 50 percent of it for fun—usually buying something I’ve been eyeing for a long time.**
- Raises. A raise is different from one-time income because you’ll get it consistently,
    - **It’s okay to increase your standard of living a little— but bank the rest.**
- If you get a raise, be realistic: You earned it, and you should enjoy the results of your hard work. Treat yourself to something nice that you’ve
  been wanting for a long time, and make it something you’ll remember.

## Save While Sleeping

- Making your accounts work together— automatically
- That’s because automating your money will be the single most profitable system you ever build.
- Instead, we’re going to play offense by building a system that acknowledges our normal human behavior— we get bored, distracted, and unmotivated—
  and uses technology to ensure we’re still growing our money.
- do the work now and benefit forever— automatically! You’re in control.
- create an Automatic Money Flow to manage your money for you. It will take the accounts you’ve set up— your credit cards and your checking, savings,
  and investment accounts— and create automatic transfers so your money goes where it needs to go.
- That’s why I love systems: You front-load the work now, then you get to benefit for years and years. By investing a little now, we don’t have to
  invest a lot later. Of course, that’s easier said than done. Somehow we just never get around to consistently managing our money—
- This is all driven by a principle I’ll call the Curve of Doing More Before Doing Less:
- By spending a few hours up front, you’ll end up saving huge amounts of time over the long term. Your money flow will be automatic, and each dollar
  that comes in will be routed to the right account in your Conscious Spending Plan
- You’ll start to see money as a tool for getting what you want without the manual drudgery of tracking categories and transferring money from one
  account to another each week.
- I read the book at 23, when I had $ 17,000 in savings. I set up a robust system of automated savings for long-term goals (retirement, emergency
  savings) and short- to medium-term goals (car repairs, vacations, even Christmas gifts); ten years later, I have $ 170,000 saved. I’ve also used the
  book to get the best deal when buying a car and negotiating cell phone bills, saving hundreds of dollars.
- The key to taking action is, quite simply, making your decisions automatic.
- Your money management must happen by default.
- If you want to build wealth over your lifetime, the only sure way to do it is to get your plan on autopilot and make everything that’s financially
  important in your life automatic.... I recommend that people automate a handful of things in their financial lives. You can set it up once in less
  than an hour and then go back to your life. —David Bach, author of The Automatic Millionaire
- To do this, I use a concept called the Next $ 100. This means, simply, where will the next $ 100 you make go?
- To see how it works, let’s use my friend Michelle as an example:
    - **1. Her paycheck goes to her checking account by direct deposit.**
- The money that remains in her account is used for guilt-free spending money. She knows that no matter what, she’s already hit her savings and
  investing goals before she spends a cent of her guilt-free money— so she can truly enjoy buying what she wants.
- In YNAB, it’s super easy to mark money that’s available for discretionary spending vs. needed for bills, and that really appeals to my analytical
  side.
- When you log in to any of your accounts, you’ll usually find an option called something like “Link Accounts,” “Transfer,” or “Set Up Payments.”
    - **1. Connect checking account to savings account**
- Highlight (yellow) - Location 3394
- If you pay rent by writing a check and sticking it in an envelope each month, log in to your checking account and set up automatic bill pay for your
  rent. Your bank will then write a check for you each month and mail it to your landlord.
- How to connect your accounts
- working with each individual account’s website to make sure your payment or transfer is set up for the amount you want and on the date you want.
- To accomplish this, gather all your bills together, call the companies, and ask them to switch your billing dates.
- “Hi, I’m currently being billed on the seventeenth of each month, and I’d like to change that to the first of the month. Do I need to do anything
  besides ask right here on the phone?” (Of course, depending on your situation,
- Automatic Money Flow, assuming you get paid on the first of the month.
    - **2nd of the month: Part of your paycheck is automatically sent to your 401( k). The remainder (your “take-home pay”) is direct-deposited into
      your checking account.**
- 2nd of the month: Part of your paycheck is automatically sent to your 401( k). The remainder (your “take-home pay”) is direct-deposited into your
  checking account.
- 5th of the month: Automatic transfer to your savings account.
- if you can’t afford that much right now, don’t worry— just set up an automatic transfer for $ 5 to prove to yourself that it works. The amount isn’t
  important: $ 5 won’t be missed, but once you see how it’s all working together, it’s much easier to add to that amount.
- 5th of the month: Automatic transfer to your Roth IRA.
- 7th of the month: Auto-pay for any monthly bills you have. Log in to any regular payments you have, like cable, utilities, car payments, or student
  loans,
- I prefer to pay my bills using my credit card, because I earn points, I get automatic consumer protection, and I can easily track my spending using
  tools like You Need a Budget.
- 7th of the month: Automatic transfer to pay off your credit card.
- (Because your bill arrived on the first of the month, you’ll never incur late fees using this system.)
- When the Money Flows On this date... . .. these actions happen
- credit card account, also set up an email notification (this is typically under “Notifications” or “Bills”) to send you a monthly link to your bill,
  so you can review it before the money is automatically transferred out of your checking account.
- If you’re paid twice a month: Replicate the above system on the first and the fifteenth—
- Another way to work your system is to do half the payments with one paycheck (retirement, fixed costs) and half the payments with the second
  paycheck (savings, guilt-free spending),
- Save a “buffer” of money, which you can use to simulate getting paid once a month.
- If you have irregular income: I know lots of freelancers and others who earn $ 12,000 one month, then nothing for the next two months.
- In months where you make a lot, you’re going to save and build a buffer for the slow months. Over time, you’ll build enough of a buffer that you can
  simulate a stable income,
- The buffer should exist as a sub-account in your savings account. To fund it, use money from two places: First, forget about investing while you’re
  setting up the buffer, and instead take any money you would have invested and send it to your savings account. Second, in good months, any extra
  dollar you make should go into your buffer savings.
- I pay with my credit card as much as possible because it lets me automatically download my transactions and categorize my spending. Plus, I get
  travel points and extra consumer protection, like a free additional warranty for any electronic device

## The Myth of Financial Expertise

- Why professional wine tasters and stock pickers are clueless— and how you can beat them
- We think “investing” is about guessing the next best stock. (It's not.)
- overwhelmed by all the options: small-, mid-, and large-cap stocks; REITS; bonds; growth, value, or blend funds— not to mention factoring in expense
  ratios, interest rates, allocation goals, and diversification.
- automatic investments in low-cost funds
- Do they deserve tens of thousands of your dollars in fees? If so, what kind of performance do you demand of them?
- But the truth is they simply cannot predict how high, how low, or even in which direction the market will go.
- “Am I learning anything from this? Or am I just being overwhelmed by information about the market going up one day and down another?”
- The key takeaway here is to completely ignore any predictions that pundits make.
- Mutual funds “turn over” stocks frequently, meaning they buy and sell stocks a lot
- someone beat the market for a few years doesn’t mean they’ll beat the market the next year.
- The problem is that nobody can consistently guess which funds or stocks will outperform, or even match, the market over time.
- a fund manager may be able to perform very well over the short term. But over the long term that manager will almost never beat the market because
  of expenses, fees, and the growing mathematical difficulty of picking outperforming stocks
- When you’re evaluating a fund, the only way to really gauge it is by looking at its track record for the last ten years or more.
- The only long-term solution is to invest regularly, putting as much money as possible into low-cost, diversified funds, even in an economic
  downturn.
- This is why long-term investors have a phrase they use: Focus on time in the market, not timing the market.
- Just because a company assigns five shiny stars to a fund does not mean it will perform well in the future.
- “incubator” funds. A complex may start ten small new equity funds with different in-house managers and wait to see which ones are successful.
  Suppose after a few years only three funds produce total returns better than the broad-market averages. The complex begins to market those
  successful funds aggressively, dropping the other seven and burying their records.
- Warren Buffett, for example, has produced a 20.9 percent annualized return over fifty-three years. Peter Lynch of Fidelity returned 29 percent over
  thirteen years. And Yale’s David Swensen has returned 13.5 percent over thirty-three years.
- Swensen, for example, has explained that he achieves outsize returns because of top-notch professional resources, but more important, access to
  investments that you and I will never have— such as the very best venture capital and hedge funds, which he uses to bolster his asset allocation.
- Don’t trust purported financial expertise just because of a few impressive stats.
- red flags when it comes to investing, including “whole life insurance,” “annuities,” and “primerica.”
- You should move everything to a low-cost broker.
- your adviser will freak out and use every emotional tool in his arsenal to prevent you from doing this. Therefore, communicate in writing.
- “I’m not confident that some of the decisions we made together were truly in my best interest. Whether the loss of confidence is justified or not,
  it’ll be hard to have a professional relationship going forward with how I currently feel.”
- The only reason for someone like Joe to have life insurance is if he has a dependent— not to fatten his adviser’s wallet.
- If you’re determined to get professional help, begin your search at the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors (napfa.org). These
  advisers are fee-based (they usually have an hourly rate), not commission-based,
- Google “Ramit best accounts” for the best checking and savings accounts and credit cards. I make no money from these recommendations.
- Hi Mike, I’m looking for a fee-only financial planner, and I found you on napfa.org. A little bit about me: I have about $ 10,000 in total assets— $
  3,000 in a Roth IRA (uninvested), $ 3,000 in a 401( k), and $ 4,000 in cash. I’m looking for investments that will maximize long-term returns while
  minimizing costs. If you think you can help me, I’d like to meet for half an hour and ask you some specific questions. I’d also like to hear how
  you’ve worked with similar people with similar goals. Would next Friday, 2/ 6, at 2 p.m. work? Alternatively, Monday, 2/ 9, is wide open for me.
  Thanks, Ramit
- sample questions available online (search for “financial adviser questions”),
- Are you a fiduciary? How do you make your money? Is it through commission or strictly fee-only? Are there any other fees? (You want a fee-only
  adviser who is a fiduciary, meaning they put your financial interests first.
- Have you worked with people in similar situations? What general solutions did you recommend? (Get references and call them.)
- What’s your working style? Do we talk regularly, or do I work with an assistant?
- “tax-loss harvesting,” “dollar-cost averaging,” or even “compound interest.”
- One percent can cost you 28 percent of your returns. A 2 percent fee can cost you 63 percent of your returns.
- You should ideally be paying 0.1 to 0.3 percent.
- Pundits Worth Reading
    - **1 MORGAN HOUSEL, interesting blog on psychology and money. collaborativefund.com/blog**
- Morgan Housel writes one of the most interesting blogs on psychology and money out there.
- “We can advise on taxes, wills, and trusts, and insurance.” All of these are legit— but none of them requires a commission-based adviser.
- Don’t make decisions out of fear. Trust in yourself and your financial system.
- Hire a fee-only financial adviser for a few hours or see my website for my advanced course on personal finance.
- no matter how good a mutual fund is, the returns are hampered by the large fees they charge.
- Mutual funds typically charge 1 to 2 percent of assets managed each year. (This percentage is known as a fund’s expense ratio.)
- “passive management.” This is how index funds (a cousin of mutual funds) are run. These funds work by replacing portfolio managers with computers.
  The computers don’t attempt to find the hottest stock. They simply and methodically pick the same stocks that an index holds— for
- NASDAQ index represents certain technology stocks, while the S& P 500 represents five hundred large US stocks. There are international indexes and
  even retail indexes.)
- Index funds have lower fees than mutual funds, because there’s no expensive staff to pay.
- Vanguard’s S& P 500 index fund, for example, has an expense ratio of 0.14 percent.
- But over the long term, the overall stock market has consistently returned about 8 percent after inflation.
- What seems like a small fee actually turns into a huge drag on your performance.
- If your decision was determined by fees alone, index funds would be the clear choice.
- if you’re thinking about using a broker or actively managed fund, call them and ask them a simple, point-blank question: “What were your after-tax,
  after-fee returns for the last ten, fifteen, and twenty years?”
- Learning the fundamentals will be the most profitable decision you ever make.
- “Don’t wish it was easier, wish you were better. Don’t wish for less problems, wish for more skills.” Don’t wish for someone to hold your hand like
  you’re a four-year-old skipping rope and chewing bubblegum. Wish to build discipline of long-term investing, like an adult. Others have done it and
  you can too.

## Investing Isn’t Only for Rich People

- Spend the afternoon picking a simple portfolio that will make you rich
- determine your investing style by asking yourself some key questions: Do you need your money next year, or can you let it grow for a while? Are you
  saving up for a house? Can you withstand big day-to-day changes in the stock market, or do they make you queasy?
- minimal human involvement, incurring minimal expense. My goal is to help you pick the simplest investment to get started— and to make your portfolio
  easy to maintain.
- combine a classic low-cost investing strategy with automation.
- spending most of your time choosing how your money will be distributed in your portfolio, then picking the investments
- words, your investments were generating so much money that your money was actually producing more money than your salary. That’s the Crossover
  Point, first described by Vicki Robin and Joe Dominguez in their book, Your Money or Your Life.
- Financial Independence + Retiring Early = FIRE.
- “LeanFire,” which is people who’ve decided they can live on a “lean” amount of money— often $ 30,000 to $ 50,000 a year in perpetuity. They reject
  materialism and embrace simplicity, often in an extreme way. “FatFire” is for people who want to live an extravagant life at the highest levels of
  spending.
- Remember that life is lived outside the spreadsheet. Be as aggressive as you want with your goals— dream bigger than you ever thought!— but remember
  that money is just a small part of a Rich Life.
- the major predictor of your portfolio’s volatility doesn’t stem from the individual stocks you pick, as most people think, but instead from your mix
  of stocks and bonds.
- more than 90 percent of your portfolio’s volatility is a result of your asset allocation.
- Asset allocation is your plan for investing, the way you distribute the investments in your portfolio between stocks, bonds, and cash. In other
  words, by diversifying your investments across different asset classes (like stocks and bonds or, better yet, stock funds and bond funds), you can
  control the risk in your portfolio— and therefore control how much money, on average, you’ll lose due to volatility.
- Since you cannot successfully time the market or select individual stocks, asset allocation should be the major focus of your investment strategy,
  because it is the only factor affecting your investment risk and return that you can control.
- At the bottom is the most basic level, where you can invest in stocks or bonds or just hold your money in cash.
- Above them are index and mutual funds. And finally, at the top of the pyramid, are target date funds.
- The Pyramid of Investing Options
- When you buy stock, you buy shares of a company.
- When people talk about “the market,” they’re usually referring to an index of stocks
- on average the stock market returns about 8 percent per year.
- If you invest all your money in one stock, for example, you might make a huge return, but it’s also possible the company could tank and you could
  lose it all.
- should not invest in individual stocks. Instead, we’ll choose funds, which are collections of stocks (and sometimes, for diversification, bonds).
- Bonds are essentially IOUs from companies or the government.
- bonds, especially government bonds, are generally stable and let you decrease the risk in your portfolio.
- what kind of person would invest in bonds? Let’s see: extremely stable, essentially guaranteed rate of return, but relatively small returns..
- When you have $ 10,000, you want to invest aggressively to grow it because you want to make more money. But when you have $ 10 million, your goals
  switch from aggressive growth to preservation of capital.
- If you have a lot of money, you’ll accept lower investment returns in exchange for security and safety.
- cash is money that’s sitting on the sidelines, uninvested and earning only a little money in interest from money market accounts, which are
  basically high-interest savings accounts.
- you actually lose money by holding cash once you factor inflation in.
- If you bought all different kinds of stocks or stock funds, you’d be diversified— but still only within stocks.
- It is important to diversify within stocks, but it’s even more important to allocate across the different asset classes— like stocks and bonds.
- Diversification is D for going deep into a category (for example, buying different types of stocks: large-cap, small-cap, international, and so on),
  and asset allocation is A for going across all categories (for example, stocks and bonds).
- 90 Years of Average Annual Returns for Stocks and Bonds
- Stocks Bonds Cash Higher risk Lower risk Ultra-low risk. Stored in an interest-generating money-market account, not under your mattress. 11.5% 5.2%
  3.4%
- Age and risk tolerance matter. If you’re twenty-five years old and have dozens of years to grow your money, a portfolio made up of mostly
  stock-based funds probably makes sense. But if you’re older, retirement is coming up within a few decades and you’ll want to tamp down your risk.
  Even if the market tanks, you have control over your asset allocation.
- Bonds act as a counterweight to stocks, generally rising when stocks fall and reducing the overall risk of your portfolio.
- Although it may seem counterintuitive, your portfolio will actually have better overall performance if you add bonds to the mix.
- If you’re in your twenties or early thirties and you don’t necessarily need to reduce your risk, you can simply invest in all-stock funds and let
  time mitigate any risk.
- “Once you’ve won the game, there’s no reason to take unnecessary risk.”
- Stocks and Bonds Have Many Flavors Stocks Bonds
- the broad category of “stocks” actually includes many different kinds of stocks, including large-company stocks (“ large-cap”), mid-cap stocks,
  small-cap stocks, and international stocks.
- Diversification is about safety in the long term.
- First, if you’re trying to make a quick buck off investing, you’ll usually lose money, because you have no idea what will happen in the near future.
- Highlight (orange) - Location 4358
- if we’re in our twenties and thirties, we can afford to be aggressive about investing in stocks and stock funds— even if they drop temporarily—
  because time is on our side.
- it’s important to understand the basics but not get too wrapped up in all the variables and choices. Over time, you can manage your asset allocation
  to reduce risk and get a fairly predictable return on investments.
- In 1924, mutual funds, which are just baskets filled with different types of investments (usually stocks), were invented. Instead of requiring
  investors to perform the Herculean task of picking individual stocks themselves, mutual funds allowed average investors to simply choose types of
  funds that would suit them.
- The funds provide instant diversification because they hold many different stocks.
- Active management can’t compete with passive management, which takes us to index funds, the more attractive cousin of mutual funds.
- Index funds set a lower bar: No experts. No attempts to beat the market. Just a computer that automatically attempts to match the index and keep
  costs low
- index funds are an easy, efficient way to make a significant amount of money.
- people who invest should extensively diversify and not trade. That leads them to an index fund with very low costs.”
- Advantages: Extremely low cost, easy to maintain, and tax efficient.
- If you do purchase multiple index funds, you’ll have to rebalance (or adjust your investments to maintain your target asset allocation) regularly,
  usually every twelve to eighteen months. Each fund typically requires a minimum investment, although this is often waived with automatic monthly
  investments.
- to take the easy way after all, no problem— target date funds are the easiest investment choice you’ll ever need to make. Target date funds are my
  favorite investment of all because they embody the 85 Percent Solution:
- Target date funds are simple funds that automatically diversify your investments for you based on when you plan to retire.
- target date funds would have automatically changed to a more conservative asset allocation as they approached their golden years.
- this actually makes things simple for you, because you’ll have to own only one fund, and all the rest will be taken care of for you.
- if it means it will get you investing, the benefits of having one fund that handles all of your investments make up for any shortcomings.
- Target date funds aren’t all created equal— some of them are more expensive than others— but as a general rule, they’re low cost and tax efficient.
- you’ll need between $ 100 and $ 1,000 as a minimum to buy into a fund.
- aggressive investments (which will be a fund of mostly stocks), balanced investments (this fund will contain stocks and bonds), and conservative
  investments (a more conservative mix of mostly bonds).
- Depending on what company your employer uses to administer your 401( k), your fund options may be a little pricey in terms of expense ratios (I
  consider anything over 0.75 percent expensive),
- “Target Retirement 2040,” “Target Retirement 2045,” and “Target Retirement 2050.” The main difference among these funds is how they’re allocated:
  The larger the number (which represents the year you’ll retire), the more equities (stocks) the fund has.
- they automatically reallocate over time, so you don’t have to worry about rebalancing (or buying and selling to maintain your target asset
  allocation).
- Some companies call them “target date” funds, while others call them “target retirement” or “lifecycle” funds.
- Some companies require you to invest a minimum amount— usually $ 1,000 to $ 3,000— but that fee can often be waived if you agree to automatic
  investing,
- Divide the number 72 by the return rate you’re getting, and you’ll have the number of years you must invest in order to double your money. (For the
  math geeks among us, here’s the equation: 72 ÷ return rate = number of years.)
- you could accumulate even more using the power of compounding by adding more every month.
- A Roth IRA is just an account. Once your money is in there, you have to start investing in different funds to see your money grow.
- They fail because they sell at the first sign of trouble, or because they buy and sell too often, thereby diminishing their returns with taxes and
  trading fees.
- the key to constructing a portfolio is not picking killer stocks! It’s figuring out a balanced asset allocation that will let you ride out storms
  and slowly grow,
- To illustrate how to allocate and diversify your portfolio, we’re going to use David Swensen’s recommendation as a model.
- The Swensen Model of Asset Allocation
    - **30 percent— Domestic equities**
- asset allocation is that you can actually reduce your risk while maintaining an equivalent return.
- the most popular companies: Vanguard, Schwab, and T. Rowe Price;
- as a general guideline, you can create a great asset allocation using anywhere from three to seven funds. That would cover domestic equities,
  international equities, real estate investment trusts, and perhaps a small allocation to treasury bonds.
- The first thing you want to do when picking index funds is to minimize fees. Look for the management fees (“ expense ratios”) to be low, around 0.2
  percent, and you’ll be fine. Most of the index funds at Vanguard, T. Rowe Price, and Fidelity offer excellent value.
- Second, you want to make sure the fund fits into your asset allocation.
- see what percentage of my portfolio is in equities vs. bonds or international vs. domestic.
- use the online site Personal Capital.)
- Third, note that you should absolutely look at how well the fund has returned over the last ten or fifteen years,
- Vanguard funds: Stocks (“ Equities”) 30 percent— Total Market Index/ equities (VTSMX) 20 percent— Total International Stock Index/ equities (VGTSX)
  20 percent— REIT index/ equities (VGSIX) Bonds 5 percent— Short-Term Treasury Index Fund (VSBSX) 5 percent— Intermediate-Term Treasury Index Fund (
  VSIGX) 5 percent— Vanguard Short-Term Treasury Index Fund (VSBSX) 15 percent— Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities Index Fund (VTAPX)
- you should have a list of funds that you’ll eventually buy to round out your allocation.
- Imagine if you invest $ 10,000 tomorrow and the stock drops 20 percent. At $ 8,000, it will need to increase 25 percent (not 20 percent) to get back
  to $ 10,000.
- By investing at regular intervals over time, you hedge against any drops in the price— and if your fund does drop, you’ll pick up shares at a
  discount price. In other words, by investing over time, you don’t try to time the market. You use time to your advantage.
- Vanguard research found that lump-sum investing actually beats dollar-cost averaging two-thirds of the time. Because the market tends to go up and
  stocks and bonds tend to outperform cash, investing all at once produces higher returns in most situations.
- There are many different investments besides stocks, bonds, and index and target date funds. You can invest in precious metals, real estate, private
  startups, cryptocurrency, or even art; just don’t expect very good returns.
- For most Americans, their home is their biggest “investment,” and yet, as investments go, your primary residence is not a very good one for
  individual investors.
- in general, most people confuse their house with an investment that they buy and sell for profit.
- If you do buy real estate, regardless of whether it’s to live in or to invest in, be sure to keep funding the rest of your investment areas— whether
  that’s a target date fund or your own portfolio of index funds.
- “The returns of fine art have been significantly overestimated, and the risk, underestimated.”
- That return works out to 10.9 percent per year— an excellent return, except for one thing: Two pieces of art account for half the value of the
  collection.
- I set aside about 10 percent of my portfolio for fun money, which includes particular stocks I like, know, and use (companies like Amazon that focus
  on customer service, which I believe drives shareholder value); sector funds that let me focus on particular industries (I own an index fund that
  focuses on health care); and even angel investing, which is personal investing for private ultra-early-stage companies.
- I bought stock in a company called JDS Uniphase (JDSU), an optical communications company. The stock effectively went to zero. I bought stock in a
  company called Excite, an early search engine, which was renamed Excite@ Home after being acquired. It went bankrupt. And then I bought roughly $
  11,000 in a little company called Amazon.com.
- It’s very important to know WHY you win and why you lose. I won with this Amazon investment, but it wasn’t because I was a good investor. It was,
  purely and simply, luck—
- Investing isn’t about picking individual stocks.
- Getting started early mattered a lot.
- The only catch with being a contrarian is you have to actually be right.
- Very few merchants accept cryptocurrency.
- Cryptocurrency allows people to use cryptography and decentralization to remain anonymous.
- Bitcoin is one example of a cryptocurrency using “blockchain” technology, which uses cryptography and a decentralized architecture.
- 80 percent of ICOs (initial coin offerings) were, and I quote, “identified as scams.”
- Investment returns in Bitcoin increased hugely in 2017. From January to June, it had increased by 240 percent compared to 9 percent for the S& P
  500. Hard to argue against that. But irregular returns are a larger problem than most people realize.
- once you have a solid portfolio in place, I encourage you to invest 5 to 10 percent in something fun! Just make sure you have a fully functioning
  portfolio first, meaning you’ve completed the Ladder of Investing, you have six months of emergency funds, and you limit your exposure by
  periodically rebalancing.
- action steps week six
    - **1 Figure out your investing style (thirty minutes).**
- Decide whether you want the simple investment options of a target date fund or the increased control (and complexity) of index funds. I recommend a
  target date fund as the 85 Percent Solution.
- 2 Research your investments (three hours to one week).
- research the funds from Vanguard, T. Rowe Price, and Schwab (see contact info).
- Use the Swensen model as a basic template and prioritize which funds you’ll buy today and which you’ll get later. Once you decide on an asset
  allocation, research funds using a fund screener like the one at Vanguard (search “Vanguard fund screener”).
- 3 Buy your fund( s) (one hour to one week).

## How to Maintain and Grow Your System

- You’ve done the hard work. What’s next? Here’s how to maintain (and grow) your financial infrastructure to achieve your Rich Life.
- put the 85 Percent Solution into place and dealt with the most important parts of your finances: your credit cards, bank accounts, spending, and
  investments.
- Get Honest About Why You Want More
- The concept of winning becomes the goal instead of knowing why you’re playing in the first place. When do you get to stop and enjoy all the hard
  work you’ve done?
    - **Don't do this**
- They’ve become obsessed with the game without realizing why they’re playing. You do not want to live in the spreadsheet. Life is more than tweaking
  your asset allocation and running Monte Carlo simulations on your investments.
- When I ask you, “Why do you want more?” the common answers are “freedom” or “security.” Those are fine, but I want to challenge you to go deeper.
  The problem is that high-level, vague visions never motivate us as much as we’d hope. True motivation is often real, concrete— on the street. It’s
  something that affects our day-to-day.
- How to Accumulate More and Grow Faster: Feed Your System
- The automatic system is great, but it’s fueled by only one thing: the money you feed it. That means that your system is only as strong as the amount
  you put in it.
- For example, if you want to FIRE (become Financially Independent and Retire Early) in fifteen years, you know to double down and save/ invest
  aggressively.
- With enough planning (and, depending on your goals, a high enough income), you can often do both. Remember: Because the rewards of investing as
  early as possible are so tremendous, one of your key drivers will be feeding as much as possible into your system.
- Every dollar you invest today will be worth many more tomorrow.
- Optimizing your plan might involve doing some serious bargaining when you make major purchases like a car or house (see Chapter 9). Or you might
  need to cut your expenses as ruthlessly as possible,
- automatically paying my bills, automating savings, and planning the whole year’s worth of expenses. Now I have even automated monthly donations to
  charity as well.
- Rebalancing Your Investments
- Rebalancing your portfolio will make sure your assets remain properly allocated and protect you from being vulnerable to a specific sector’s ups and
  downs.
- stop sending money there temporarily and redistribute that 30 percent of your investment contribution evenly over the rest of your investment
  categories. You can do this by “pausing” your automatic investment to particular funds
- stop investing in the outperforming area and grow the other areas of your portfolio until your allocation is back in line with your goals.
- There is another way to rebalance, but I don’t like doing it. You can rebalance by selling the outperforming equities and plowing the money into
  other areas to bring the allocation back under control. I hate selling, because it involves trading fees, paperwork, and “thinking,” so I don’t
  recommend this.
- set a calendar reminder to resume your automatic payments for the asset class you paused
- free financial dashboard at personalcapital.com to help guide your rebalancing.
- Stop Worrying About Taxes
- data shows that small tax refunds that are gradually added to your paycheck get spent. Big tax refunds get saved or used to pay off debt.
- “marginal tax brackets.” If you start earning more and move up tax brackets, the “marginal” amount— or the money in the higher tax bracket— is taxed
  at a higher rate, not the entire amount you earn.
    - **For example (ballpark), **
- loopholes. There are a few legit ones— like tax efficiency in your investment accounts, maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, and a few more—
- Taxes are a great example of where the 85 Percent Solution applies. (Quick refresher on the 85 Percent Solution: Make a few key decisions, get “good
  enough” to be mostly right, then move on with your life.) The solution here is to take full advantage of your tax-deferred accounts (more on this
  below). If you’re doing this, you’re saving thousands of dollars in taxes every year.
- But the real “rich people” tax benefits begin when you’re earning millions of dollars from your existing investments.
- The Annual Financial Checklist
    - **EVALUATE YOUR CONSCIOUS SPENDING PLAN (THREE HOURS)**
- It’s important to maintain your automated financial system. Every year, I spend a few hours re-reviewing my system and making any changes necessary.
- I recommend December so you can start the next year off right—
- The government has created incentives for long-term investing: If you sell an investment that you’ve held for less than a year, you’ll be subject to
  ordinary income tax, which is usually 25 to 35 percent.
- If, however, you hold your investment for more than a year, you’ll pay only a capital-gains tax, which is much lower than your usual tax rate.
- buy-and-hold investing produces dramatically higher returns than frequent trading.
- Invest in retirement accounts and hold your investments for the long term.
- When you’re young, there are only three reasons to sell an investment: You need the money for an emergency, you made a terrible investment and it’s
  consistently underperforming the market, or you’ve achieved your specific goal for investing.
- You Need the Money for an Emergency
    - **1 Use your savings account.**
- With a 401( k), you can take money out for “hardship withdrawals,” which typically include medical expenses, buying a home, tuition, preventing
  foreclosure, and funeral expenses, but you’ll probably still pay early withdrawal fees.
- If you own a home, you do need insurance, but young, single people don’t need life insurance.
- we hardly ever die, and the insurance payout is useful only for people who depend on your livelihood, like your spouse and kids.
- Insurance is almost never a good investment, despite what financial salespeople (or clueless parents) will tell you. So use it as protection from
  downside risk—
- The best way to prepare yourself is to talk to successful people who are somewhat older than you and have their act together.
- To oversimplify it, if your “total market index fund” is going down, that means the entire market is down. If you believe the market will recover,
  that means investments are on sale for cheaper prices than before, meaning not only should you not sell, but you should keep investing and pick up
  shares at a cheaper price.
    - ***Choose target date fund and index fund, never need to sell investments **
- If you’re selling outside of a retirement account, there are many tax considerations, such as tax-loss harvesting (which lets you offset capital
  gains with losses),
- if your goal is less than five years away, you should set up a savings goal in your savings account. But if you’ve invested money for a longer-term
  goal that you’ve achieved, sell and don’t think twice. That’s a great investing success, and you should use the money for whatever your original
  goal was.

## A Rich Life

- The finances of relationships, weddings, buying a car, your first house, and more
- Living a Rich Life happens outside the spreadsheet. It’s tempting to tinker with online calculators and asset allocations for years and years,
- For me, a Rich Life is about freedom— it’s about not having to think about money all the time and being able to travel and work on the things that
  interest me. It’s about being able to use money to do whatever I want— and not having to worry about taking a taxi or ordering what I want at a
  restaurant or how I’ll ever be able to afford a house.
- Student Loans— Pay Them Down or Invest?
- Statistics clearly show that college graduates far outearn those with only a high school diploma. (That said, you should take responsibility for
  researching college majors and their average salaries.)
- Do a hybrid 50/ 50 approach, where you pay half toward your student loans
- It won’t really matter whether you pay off your student loans or invest, because you’ll get roughly the same return. Except for two things: compound
  interest and tax-advantaged retirement accounts.
- mastering love and money is one of the most complex— and rewarding— parts of a Rich Life.
- the real challenges— and opportunities— lie in the softer discussions.
- Ignore the Noise of Money Advice
- Everyone’s got advice. Everyone has a different way they handle money. Some know more than others, but everyone has an opinion on what you should
  do. Suddenly you’ll be hyperaware of how other people handle their money.
- Ignore the noise. Remember, investing shouldn’t be dramatic or even fun— it should be methodical, calm, and as fun as watching grass grow.
- seek out more information. Do it. Just keep it in perspective and realize that everyone has an angle but there are no tricks or hacks to long-term
  personal finance.
- How to Help Parents Who Are in Debt
- You are more likely to bring up money than they are. And you have the perfect excuse— this book. Like this: “Mom, I’ve been reading this book on
  personal finance. I learned a lot of things I never knew. How did you learn about money?”
- If your parents are in debt, it can be very tough on your relationship with them. Your biggest challenge is not going to be coming up with a
  technical personal finance solution for their problem. Instead, it’s going to be asking lots of questions, listening carefully, and deciding if they
  actually want help, and if they’re ready to receive it.
- ■ Where did they learn about money? What did their parents teach them? ■ If they could wave a magic wand and be in any financial situation, what
  would it be? (Let them dream here. If they say “win the lottery,” encourage them. What would that mean? What would they do? Then get more realistic:
  “Okay, let’s assume you can’t win the lottery. What would your ideal situation look like five years from now?” Most parents have pragmatic dreams.)
  ■ How much do they make per month? How much do they spend? ■ What percentage of their income are they saving? (Almost nobody knows this. Be
  reassuring, not judgmental.) ■ Do they pay fees for their bank accounts and credit cards? ■ What’s their average monthly credit card balance? Out of
  curiosity (use that phrase), why isn’t it zero? How could they get it there? ■ Do they have any investments? If so, how did they choose them? ■ Do
  they own a mutual fund or funds? How much are they paying in fees? ■ Are they maximizing their 401( k) s, at least contributing as much as their
  company matches? ■ What about other retirement vehicles, like a Roth IRA? Do they have one?
- Should You Tell Your Parents and Friends How Much Money You Have?
- Chris pointed out that I’d been thinking a single number would communicate all of this, but in reality, I could assure my parents in lots of
  different ways. I could simply tell them my business was doing well. I could thank them for teaching me the discipline to grow a business. And I
  could do the thing that’s most meaningful to parents: spend time with them.
- In reality, my parents don’t care about the number in my bank account—
- ask yourself why: Is it to communicate that you’re doing well? Or is it to subtly show off? Are there other ways of communicating this? Remember,
  sharing numbers without context is a bad move. Your intention might be good, but to someone who earns $ 60,000, telling them you’re on track to have
  a $ 1 million portfolio (or much more) doesn’t communicate safety and security. It communicates arrogance.
- The specific tactics aren’t as important as your attitude going in. The key is to be nonjudgmental and to ask lots of questions.
- “I’ve been thinking about my personal finances a lot and I’d love to get on the same page with you. Can we talk about it?” ■ “How do you think about
  money? Like some people like to spend more on rent and other people like to save a certain percentage. I think I overspend on eating out. Speaking
  broadly, what are your general thoughts about money?” (Notice that I started off broad, then offered examples, then offered a confession about an
  area I’m not great in. Start by being vulnerable with your own finances.) ■ “If you could wave a magic wand, what would you be doing with your
  money? For me, I know I should be investing in my 401( k), but to tell you the truth, I haven’t filled out the paperwork yet.” (Another admission—
  only if true, of course.) ■ “How should we use our money together? Have you thought about whether you’d want to change anything?” (This is where you
  can discuss how you share expenses, if you’re saving toward joint goals, or what fun things you want to use your money for.)
- The goal of this conversation should be to agree that money is important to both of you and that you want to work together to help each other with
  finances.
- ■ A list of your accounts and the amount in each ■ A list of debts and what the interest rates are ■ Monthly expenses (see table for details on how
  to determine this) ■ Your total income ■ Any money that is owed to you ■ Your short-term and long-term financial goals
- When you sit down, put the paper aside and start by talking about goals. From a financial perspective, what do you want? What kind of lifestyle do
  you expect? What about vacations in the next year? Does either of you need to support your parents? Then look at your monthly spending.
- “What do you think I could be doing better?” And then it’s your partner’s turn. Spend some time talking about your attitudes toward money. How do
  you treat money? Do you spend more than you make? Why? How did your parents talk about money? How did they manage it?
- The most important goal of this conversation is to normalize talking about money, which is why we want to keep it as light as possible. The second
  goal is for you both to get to a “baseline” of money management, making sure you’re each saving and investing and paying off debt
- At this point, it’s probably better not to run through all the numbers for a really large purchase, because that can get overwhelming. Just
  establish a savings goal or two and set up an automatic monthly transfer for each of you. Longer term, you and your partner should work together to
  get on the same page with your money attitudes.
- When One Person Earns More Than the Other
- dividing expenses based proportionately on income.
- Or one person can cover certain expenses, like groceries, while the other handles rent. The key takeaway here is to discuss it, come to an agreement
  that feels fair
- What to Do if Your Partner Spends Money Irresponsibly
- The solution is to elevate the conversation beyond you and your partner. If you keep trying to tell your partner not to spend money on something, he
  or she will resent it and ignore you. People absolutely hate to be judged
- steer it away from you and your partner and instead refocus on the plan. Nobody can get defensive when you’re pointing to a piece of paper
- By focusing on the plan, not the person, you’re more likely to be able to sidestep the perception of being judgmental and work on bringing spending
  in line with your goals.

- I thought reducing the number of guests would produce the biggest result. I was wrong. Interestingly, changing the number of guests doesn’t change
  the cost as much as you’d imagine.
- negotiating for better prices on the venue and food— the best suggestion I’ve heard about cutting wedding costs is to tackle the fixed costs.
- Sample wedding Costs
- Who needs a prenup? In pop culture, it’s celebrities, industrial tycoons, and wealthy heirs— three groups I’m not a member of. As I researched
  further, I found that most people don’t need a prenup unless one of you has a disproportionate amount of assets or liabilities relative to the
  other— or
- In reality, a prenup is an agreement on assets that were accumulated before the marriage, not just what’s jointly accumulated during the marriage—
  plus an agreement on what to do if the marriage ends.
- The next thing I realized was that the best information about prenups isn’t available publicly.
- I later discovered that because prenups are, by definition, customized, high-stakes legal agreements for wealthy individuals, there is no incentive
  to publicize how they actually work.
- Take what you read online with a grain of salt.
- Marriage is about finding a partner you love and want to spend the rest of your life with. It’s also a legal contract with significant financial
  ramifications.
- I reassured her that I planned for our marriage to be forever. “I love you and I’m excited to get married and be with you for the rest of my life.”
  I told her why we were even talking about this. “Because of a few decisions and a lot of luck with my business, I’m coming to this relationship with
  more money than most people. I don’t think we’ll ever need to use a prenup, but it’s important to me that I protect the assets I’ve accumulated
  before we get married.” I emphasized marriage was about creating a team. “When we get married, we’re a team. I want you to know I’ll look out for
  you, and I know you’ll look out for me.” I emphasized our lifestyle. “You and I grew up almost the same. Both our moms are teachers. You see what I
  spend my money on— it’s not sports cars or bottle service. It’s basically living a comfortable life (with a few nice things). I love sharing this
  lifestyle with you and with our families.” But I was firm about wanting to sign a prenup. “I’m proud of what I’ve accomplished with my business and
  finances. It’s important to me that I protect those assets in the worst case that we separate.”
- We talked about what money meant to us, we circled back to why I wanted one, and when we dug in to the actual numbers, we talked about what those
  numbers meant.
- We talked about risk and security. How does money make you feel? Do you need a certain amount in your bank account to feel safe? Are you
  risk-averse?
- I would have talked through how to manage our lawyers. Your lawyer naturally wants to protect you from every contingency, while your partner’s
  lawyer wants to protect them.
- There are prenups, postnups, amendments, and so much more.
- In fact, negotiating your salary at a new job is the fastest legal way to make money. Your starting salary is even more important
- Negotiating Your Salary,
- the single best time to negotiate salary is when you’re starting a new job.
- When I coach people on negotiation, I pretend to be the hiring manager and ask the toughest questions they might get.
- Negotiating is 90 percent about mindset and 10 percent about tactics.
- I hit negotiations hard and prepared. I get something extra, whether it’s time or money, every time I negotiate.
- The basics of negotiating
-
    1. Remember that nobody cares about you.
- When it comes to you, your manager cares about two things— how you’re going to make him or her look better, and how you’re going to help the company
  do well.
- Negotiating tactic: Always frame your negotiation requests in a way that shows how the company will benefit. Don’t focus on the amount you’ll cost
  the company. Instead, illustrate how much value you can provide the company.
- highlight the ways you’ll help your company hit its goals. Your key phrase here is “Let’s find a way to arrive at a fair number that works for both
  of us.” 2. Have another job offer— and use it.
- Negotiating tactic: Interview with multiple companies at once. Be sure to let each company know when you get another job offer, but don’t reveal the
  amount of the exact offer—
-
    3. Come prepared (99 percent of people don’t). Don’t just pick a salary out of thin air.
- Negotiating tactic: Most of the negotiation happens outside the room. Call your contacts. Figure out the salary amount you’d love, what you can
  realistically get, and what you’ll settle for. And don’t just ask for money. Literally bring a strategic plan of what you want to do in the position
  and hand it to your hiring manager.
- in a job interview, you’ll want to have a list of things in your head that you can use to strengthen your negotiation. Think about your strong
  points and figure out ways you might be able to bring them to the hiring manager’s attention.
- often ask, “What qualities make someone do an extraordinary job in this position?” If they say, “The person should be very focused on metrics,” I
  say, “That’s great that you said that— we’re really on the same page. In fact, when I was at my last company, I launched a product that used
- Negotiating tactic: Have a repertoire of your accomplishments and aptitudes at your fingertips that you can include in your responses to commonly
  asked questions.
- ■ Stories about successes you’ve had at previous jobs that illustrate your key strengths ■ Questions to ask the negotiator if the conversation gets
  off track (“ What do you like most about this job? . .. Oh, really? That’s interesting, because when I was at my last job, I found...”) 5. Negotiate
  for more than money. Don’t forget to discuss whether or not the company offers a bonus, stock options, flexible commuting, or further education.
- Negotiating tactic: Your line is “Let’s talk about total comp,” which refers to your total compensation— not just salary, but everything. Treat them
  each as levers: If you pull one up, you can afford to let another fall. Use the levers strategically— for example, by conceding something you don’t
  really care about— so you can both come to a happy agreement.
-
    6. Be cooperative, not adversarial.
- If you’ve gotten to the point of negotiating a salary, the company wants you and you want them. Now you just need to figure out how to make it work.
- You should be confident, not cocky, and eager to find a deal that benefits you both.
- Negotiating tactic: The phrase to use here is “We’re pretty close... Now let’s see how we can make this work.”
-
    7. Smile. I’m not joking. This is one of the most effective techniques in negotiation.
-
    8. Practice negotiating with multiple friends.
-
    9. If it doesn’t work, save face. Sometimes the hiring manager simply won’t budge.
- Negotiating tactic: Your line here is “I understand you can’t offer me what I’m looking for right now. But let’s assume I do an excellent job over
  the next six months. Assuming my performance is just extraordinary, I’d like to talk about renegotiating then. I think that’s fair, right?” (Get the
  hiring manager to agree.) “Great. Let’s put that in writing and we’ll be good to go.”
- Five Things You Should Never Do in a Negotiation 1. Don’t tell them your current salary.
- If you’re asked, say, “I’m sure we can find a number that’s fair for both of us.” If they press you, push back: “I’m not comfortable revealing my
  salary, so let’s move on. What else can I answer for you?”
- If they ask you to suggest a number, smile and say, “Now come on, that’s your job. What’s a fair number that we can both work from?”
-
    3. If you’ve got another offer from a company that’s generally regarded to be mediocre, don’t reveal the company’s name.
- say something general but true, like “It’s another tech company that focuses on online consumer applications.”
-
    4. Don’t ask “yes” or “no” questions.
-
    5. Never lie.
- I broke down their job posting
- I researched their website extensively,
- I prepared a spiel about my somewhat eclectic résumé,
- “Tell them you want to get your hands dirty” and “Suggest three things you would do to improve/ enhance their marketing efforts.”
- I never actually found a good opportunity to mention my ideas (this despite a four-hour interview). I emailed the proposals to my potential boss
  instead. I then individually emailed every person I spoke to that day to thank them for their time.
- carefully researched her options, took action, reached out to more experienced people for advice, and came in with a presentation
- How to Save Thousands on Big-Ticket Items
- When you buy something major, you can save massive amounts of money— $ 2,000 on a car or $ 40,000 on a house— that will make your other attempts to
  save money pale in comparison.
- Buying a Car
- from a financial perspective, the most important factor is how long you keep the car before you sell it.
- understand how much you can afford, pick a reliable car, maintain it well, and drive it for as long as humanly possible. Yes, that means you need to
  drive it for more than ten years, because it’s only once you finish the payments that the real savings start.
- There are four steps to buying a car: Budgeting, Picking a Car, Negotiating Like an Indian, and Maintaining Your Car.
- First, ask yourself how buying a car fits into your spending and saving priorities
- Once you’ve thought about where your car fits into your priorities, you need to look at your Conscious Spending Plan and decide what you’re willing
  to allocate toward your car each month.
- if you can afford a total monthly payment of $ 500 toward your car, you can probably afford a car that costs $ 200 to $ 250 per month.
- when I lived in San Francisco, my monthly car payment of $ 350.75 actually added up to around $ 1,000 when I factored in insurance, gas,
  maintenance, and $ 200/ month in parking.) With a budget of around $ 200 per month for your car itself, that means you can afford a car that costs
  around $ 12,000 over five years.
- First, any car you evaluate must fit within your budget. This will eliminate most cars automatically. Do not even look at cars you can’t afford.
  Second, the car must be a good car.
    - **Reliability **
- avoid car-repair issues that cost time and money
- To check out how your potential cars will fare, visit the Kelley Blue Book site at kbb.com and calculate resale prices in five, seven, and ten
  years. You’ll be surprised how quickly most cars depreciate and how others (Toyotas and Hondas especially) retain their value.
- The insurance rates for a new and used car can be pretty different. Even if they’re only slightly different (say, $ 50/ month), that can add up over
  many years.
- It makes a lot of sense to factor this in, especially if you drive a lot.
- a used car is more attractive because the down payment
- The interest rate on your car loan will depend on your credit, which is why having a good credit score matters.
- Dos and Don’ts for Buying a Car
- Calculate total cost of ownership (TCO).
- Besides the cost of the car and the interest on your loan, the TCO should include maintenance, gas, insurance, and resale value.
- Buy a car that will last you at least ten years,
- Lease.
- Buy a car and hold it for the long term. Years ago, Consumer Reports found that buying an average sedan, the Honda Accord, would cost “$ 4,597 less
  over five years than leasing the exact same model.” I ran the same calculation with a new model Toyota Camry and found the same thing: Buying would
  save $ 6,000 over six years versus leasing— and even more over time.
- Sell your car in fewer than seven years. The real savings come once you’ve paid off your car loan and driven it for as long as possible.
- Assume you have to buy a used car. Run the numbers. Over the long term, a new car may end up saving you money if you pick the right new car,
- Stretch your budget for a car.
- If you’re not a hardball negotiator, take someone with you who is. If possible, buy a car at the end of the year, when dealers are salivating to
  beat their quotas and are far more willing to negotiate.
- Here’s how I did it: When I decided to buy— at the end of December, when salespeople are desperate to meet their quotas— I reached out to seventeen
  car dealers and told them exactly which car I wanted. I said I was prepared to buy the car within two weeks and, because I knew exactly how much
  profit they would make off the car, I would go with the lowest price offered to me. The same day, as I sat back with a cup of Earl Grey tea and
  three tacos with habanero salsa, responses started rolling in from the dealers. After I had all the offers, I called the dealers, told them the
  lowest price I’d received, and gave each of them a chance to beat it. This resulted in a bidding war that led to a downward spiral of near-orgasmic
  deals.
- As soon as you buy your car, enter the major maintenance checkpoints into your calendar so you remember them. Here’s a hint: The average car is
  driven about fifteen thousand miles per year. You can use that number as a starting point to calculate a maintenance schedule based on the car
  manufacturer’s instructions. Of course, you also need to have regular oil changes, watch your tire pressure, and keep your car clean. I keep a
  record of each service I have, along with any notes. When I sell my car, I’ll show the documentation to the buyer to prove how meticulous I’ve
  been (and charge the buyer accordingly).
- Buying a House
- When you buy a house worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, you should be an expert on common mistakes most home buyers make. You should know all
  the common real estate terms, as well as how to push and pull to get the best deal. And you should understand that houses are primarily for living
  in, not for making huge cash gains.
- I’m going to help you figure out if buying a house is right for you, and then I’m going to give you an overview of the things you’ll need to do over
  the next few months— at least three months, probably twelve— to prepare to buy. I can’t cover all the tips here, but I’ll get you started with the
  basics.
- Actually, houses really aren’t very good investments in general.
- In the olden days, this meant that your house would cost no more than 2.5 times your annual income, you’d be able to put at least 20 percent of the
  purchase price down, and the total monthly payments (including the mortgage, maintenance, insurance, and taxes) would be about 30 percent of your
  gross income.
- Can you afford at least a 20 percent down payment for the house? If not, set a savings goal and don’t even think about buying until you reach it.
  Even if you’ve got a down payment, you still need to be sure you make enough money to cover the monthly payments.
- when you buy a house, you’ll owe property taxes, insurance, and maintenance fees
- it. Unless you’re already loaded, you need to readjust your expectations and begin with a starter house. They’re called that for a reason— they’re
  simple houses that require you to make trade-offs but allow you to get started. Your first house probably won’t have as many bedrooms as you want.
  It won’t be in the most amazing location. But it will let you get started making consistent monthly payments and building equity.
- Buy only if you’re planning to live in the same place for ten years or more.
- Buying a house changes your lifestyle forever. No matter what, you have to make your monthly payment every month— or you’ll lose your house and
  watch your credit tank. This affects the kinds of jobs you can take and your level of risk tolerance. It means you’ll need to save for a six-month
  emergency plan in case you lose your job and can’t pay your mortgage. In short, you really need to be sure you’re ready for the responsibility of
  being a homeowner.
- Real Estate Is a Poor Investment for Most Individual Investors
- If your house is your biggest investment, how diversified is your portfolio?
- Yale economist Robert Shiller found that from 1915 through 2015, home prices have increased, on average, only 0.6 percent per year.
- factor in important costs like property taxes, maintenance, and the opportunity cost of not having that money in the stock market.
- It’s just that you should think of it as a purchase, rather than as an investment.
- renting is actually a smart decision for many people, especially if you live in an expensive area
- moving costs, the cost of new furniture, renovations, and the real estate fees when you sell the house—
- When you rent, you’re not paying all those other assorted fees, which effectively frees up tons of cash that you would have been spending on a
  mortgage. The key is investing that extra money.
- The easiest way to see if you should rent or buy is to use the New York Times’s excellent online calculator “Is It Better to Rent or Buy?” It will
  factor in maintenance, renovations, capital gains, the costs of buying and selling, inflation, and more.
- I’m conservative when it comes to real estate. That means I urge you to stick by tried-and-true rules, like 20 percent down, a 30-year fixed-rate
  mortgage, and a total monthly payment that represents no more than 30 percent of your gross income. If you can’t do that, wait until you’ve saved
  more.
- If you make a good financial decision when buying, you’ll be in an excellent position. You’ll know exactly how much you’re spending each month on
  your house, you’ll be in control of your expenses,
    - **1. Check your credit score.**
- And don’t forget to factor in insurance, taxes, maintenance, and renovations. If all this sounds a little overwhelming, it’s telling you that you
  need to research all this stuff before buying a house. In this particular case, you should ask your parents and other homeowners for their surprise
  costs or just search “surprise costs of owning a house.”
- I like a thirty-year fixed-rate loan. Yes, you’ll pay more in interest compared with a fifteen-year loan. But a thirty-year loan is more flexible,
  because you can take the full thirty years to repay it or pay extra toward your loan and pay it off faster if you want. But you probably shouldn’t:
  Consumer Reports simulated what to do with an extra $ 100 per month, comparing the benefits of prepaying your mortgage versus investing in an index
  fund that returned 8 percent. Over a twenty-year period, the fund won
- The government wants to make it easy for first-time home buyers to purchase a house.
-
    1. Acknowledge that you’re probably not being realistic about how much things will cost— then force yourself to be.
-
    2. Set up an automatic savings plan.
-
    3. You can’t have the best of everything, so use the P word. Priorities are essential. Like I said, it’s human nature to want the best for our
       wedding day or first house, and we need to be realistic about acknowledging that. But we also need to acknowledge that we simply can’t have the
       best of everything.
- Giving Back:
- The point is that now you’ve got a personal finance system that few others have. This allows you to elevate your goals beyond making it through the
  daily grind. When you think back to last year, what was the one big thing you accomplished for others? What will it be this year? If I could hope
  for one thing from this book, it would be that you become a master of conscious spending— and then apply those skills to helping those around you.
- Anyone can be rich— it’s just a question of what rich means to you.

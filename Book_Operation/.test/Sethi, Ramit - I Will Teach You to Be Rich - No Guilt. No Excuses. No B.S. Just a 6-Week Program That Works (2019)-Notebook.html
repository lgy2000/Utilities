Too many of us get overwhelmed thinking we need to manage our money perfectly, which leads us to do nothing at all. That’s why the easiest way to manage your money is to take it one step at a time— and not worry about being perfect. I’d rather act and get it 85 percent right than do nothing. Think about it: 85 percent of the way is far better than zero percent. Once your money system is good enough— or 85 percent of the way there— you can get on with your life and go do the things you really want to do.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 434</div><div class='noteText'>It’s okay to make mistakes. It’s better to make them now, with a little bit of money, so that when you have more, you’ll know what to avoid.</h3>

I have readers who earn $ 50,000/ year and ones who earn $ 750,000/ year. They both buy the same loaves of bread. Controlling spending is important, but your earnings become super-linear.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 502</div><div class='noteText'>Build a collection of “spending frameworks” to use when deciding on buying something. Most people default to restrictive rules (“ I need to cut back on eating out  .  .  .”), but you can flip it and decide what you’ll always spend on, like my book-buying rule: If you’re thinking about buying a book, just buy it. Don’t waste even five seconds debating it.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 507</div><div class='noteText'>Sometimes the most advanced thing you can do is the basics, consistently.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 510</div><div class='noteText'>Part of creating your Rich Life is the willingness to be unapologetically different. Once money isn’t a primary constraint, you’ll have the freedom to design your own Rich Life, which will almost certainly be different from the average person’s.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 519</div><div class='noteText'>Investing isn’t about picking stocks. In fact, your investment plan is actually more important than any individual investment you make.</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_orange'>orange</span>) - Location 529</div><div class='noteText'>action Steps IN WEEK 1, you’ll set up your credit cards, pay off debt (if applicable), and learn how to master your credit history and free credit rewards. IN WEEK 2, you’ll set up the right bank accounts. IN WEEK 3, you’ll open a 401( k) and an investment account (even if you have just $ 100 to start). IN WEEK 4, you’ll figure out how much you’re spending. And then you’ll figure out how to make your money go where you want it to go. IN WEEK 5, you’ll automate your new infrastructure to make your accounts play together nicely. IN WEEK 6, you’ll learn why investing isn’t the same as picking stocks— and how you can get the most out of the market with very little work.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 538</div><div class='noteText'>You’ll also learn to choose a low-cost automatic portfolio that beats typical Wall Street portfolios, and find out how to maintain your investments by setting up a system that lets you remain as hands-off as possible while your money accumulates automatically.

<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Optimize Your Credit Cards</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 546</div><div class='noteText'>How to beat the credit card companies at their own game</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 569</div><div class='noteText'>It’s not worth negotiating everything, but there are a few areas of life where negotiation is a Big Win.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 595</div><div class='noteText'>Credit cards give you thousands of dollars worth of perks. If you pay your bill on time, they’re a free short-term loan. They can help you keep track of your spending much more easily than cash, and they let you download your transaction history for free. Most offer free warranty extensions on your purchases and free rental car insurance. Many offer rewards and points worth hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Credit cards are also convenient enemies. Almost everyone has a bad story about late fees, unauthorized charges, or overspending.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 601</div><div class='noteText'>The truth about credit cards lies somewhere between these two extremes. As long as you manage them well, they’re worth having. But if you don’t completely pay off your bill at the end of the month, you’ll owe an enormous amount of interest on the remainder, usually about 14 percent. This is what’s known as the annual percentage rate, or APR. Credit card companies also tack on a whopping fee every time you miss a payment— usually around $ 35. It’s also easy to overuse credit cards and find yourself in debt, as many American credit card users have done.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 605</div><div class='noteText'>instead of playing defense by avoiding credit cards altogether, I want you to play offense by using credit cards responsibly and getting as many benefits out of them as possible. To do so, you need to optimize your credit card( s) and use them as a spearhead to improve your overall credit. By the end of this chapter, you’ll know how to squeeze the credit card companies for everything they’re worth— without paying unnecessary fees— and you’ll know how to use your cards to boost your all-important credit score.</h3>

We had a private villa in traditional bedouin style overlooking the Dubai desert with a private pool, and all meals at the resort were provided. The whole experience easily would have cost $ 2,000-plus a night, but I did the whole thing for free with points.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 638</div><div class='noteText'>For student loans, make an aggressive plan and minimize the amount of interest you pay. For credit cards, I squeeze every single benefit out of them. Basically I want the credit card companies to hate you, as they hate me.</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 664</div><div class='noteText'>establishing good credit is the first step in building an infrastructure for getting rich. Think about it: Our largest purchases are almost always made on credit, and people with good credit save tens of thousands of dollars on these purchases.

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 666</div><div class='noteText'>There are two main components to your credit (also known as your credit history): your credit report and your credit score.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_orange'>orange</span>) - Location 668</div><div class='noteText'>Your credit report gives potential lenders basic information about you, your accounts, and your payment history. It tracks all credit-related activities (e.g., credit cards and loans), although recent activities are given higher weight.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_orange'>orange</span>) - Location 670</div><div class='noteText'>Your credit score (often called your FICO score because it was created by the Fair Isaac Corporation) is a single, easy-to-read number between 300 and 850 that represents your credit risk to lenders. It’s like an SAT score for the credit industry (higher is better). The lenders take this number and, with a few other pieces of information, such as your salary and age, decide if they’ll lend you money for credit like a credit card, mortgage, or car loan. They’ll charge you more or less for the loan depending on your score, which signifies how risky you are.</h3>

Lots of people use Credit Karma (creditkarma.com) to get a free credit score, but I prefer the official credit score from MyFico (myfico.com), which is more accurate even though it has a small fee.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_orange'>orange</span>) - Location 705</div><div class='noteText'>a high credit score can save you tens of thousands of dollars over your lifetime (or more if you live in a high-cost-of-living area). While other people spend many hours cutting coupons, agonizing over generic brands at the grocery store, or beating themselves up over a morning latte, they’re failing to see the bigger picture. It’s fine to keep a close eye on your expenses, but you should focus on spending time on the things that matter, the Big Wins. So let’s dig into tactics for improving your credit, which is quantifiably worth much more than any advice about frugality.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Location 709</div><div class='noteText'>1. Get rewarded for your spending
2. Don’t sign up for retail store credit cards
3. Don’t go card crazy</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 737</div><div class='noteText'>One of the biggest problems with credit cards is the hidden cost of using them. It may be incredibly convenient to swipe your card at every retailer, but if you don’t pay your bill every month, you’ll end up owing way more than you realize.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 755</div><div class='noteText'>How do you choose the right credit card? I have a few simple rules that I use when choosing my own cards: ■   Don’t accept credit card offers that come in the mail or from retail stores like Gap or Nordstrom. ■   Squeeze every reward you can out of your credit cards. ■   Pick a good one, then move on with your life.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 760</div><div class='noteText'>Get rewarded for your spending. There are different levels of rewards cards. Some are very basic, while others offer hundreds of dollars in annual benefits— or even thousands, depending on how much you spend. First, decide what you want to get rewarded with— cash back or travel. I recommend cash back because it’s straightforward, there are excellent cash back cards, and it’s simpler than travel rewards, which require more sophistication to truly maximize. (For more on maximizing travel rewards, look up forums on “credit card churning.”) Once you decide on the primary reward you want, use a site like bankrate.com to sort through your options.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_orange'>orange</span>) - Location 766</div><div class='noteText'>Most of the best rewards cards have fees. Are they worth it? You should run the numbers to decide, which takes less than 5 minutes. Here’s a quick rule of thumb: If you spend thousands per month on your credit card, the rewards are usually worth it. But if you spend more modestly or you’re not sure whether you want to pay a fee, spend a few minutes doing a quick analysis by searching for “credit card rewards calculator.”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - Location 779</div><div class='noteText'>This person just opened one of the most predatory cards out there to save $ 4. Jesus. You might as well reach into a dirty gutter to find a few pennies. That would be cheaper than the financial beating you’re going to eventually take.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Location 781</div><div class='noteText'>Don’t sign up for retail store credit cards.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 782</div><div class='noteText'>Why would you sign up for a retail store card that has high fees, near-extortionate interest rates, and terrible rewards?</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 791</div><div class='noteText'>A secret of the credit card industry: When you compare credit cards online, you’re entering a murky world of SEO and affiliate fees where nearly all credit card listings are compensated.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 797</div><div class='noteText'>Don’t go card crazy. Now that you’re in the market, you might be tempted by any number of card offers. But don’t overdo it.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_orange'>orange</span>) - Location 798</div><div class='noteText'>each additional card you get means added complexity for your personal finance system: more to keep track of and more places for things to go wrong. Two or three is a good rule of thumb. (The average American has four credit cards.)</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - Location 803</div><div class='noteText'>I ended up paying ~ $ 2,000 for a $ 3,000 initial balance. It completely smoked my confidence. I closed down all 11 of my cards except my CSP. Technically I’m still “ahead” but the thought of having paid $ 2,000 when I *didn’t have to* and it was *100% avoidable and in my control* was too much.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 806</div><div class='noteText'>there are other sources of credit besides credit cards. These include installment loans (such as auto loans), personal lines of credit, home equity lines of credit, and service credit (such as utilities).</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 809</div><div class='noteText'>cautioning against prescribing a specific number of credit sources. “It depends on how long you’ve been managing credit. The less information in your credit report, the higher the prominence of each new report.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_orange'>orange</span>) - Location 811</div><div class='noteText'>In short, pick two or three great cards, maximize rewards sensibly, and remember that these cards are just one part of your overall financial infrastructure.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - Location 814</div><div class='noteText'>Years ago, I decided to optimize my credit card rewards. I knew I was about 95 percent of the way there— I had cash back and travel cards for my business and personal spending— but I wanted to get truly dialed in for that last 5 percent. As my business had grown to dozens of employees, my spending had increased considerably. These rewards started to become meaningful and I wanted to be sure I was getting every benefit available. For example, at a certain point, we were spending over $ 40,000 on ads every month. I know most people don’t need to maximize points at this level. But I think it’s fascinating, and I want to share what I learned.</h3>

As I mentioned, I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about the position and what I can do to really be a top performer this year, and I’d like to discuss that with you if that’s okay. Boss: Sure. You: So the way I see it, my role in the position can be broken down into three main areas: A, B, and C. I think I’m doing pretty well with A, and I’m picking up B pretty rapidly. And I need a little help with C, as we’ve discussed before. Does that sound about right to you? Boss: Yes, that sounds right. You: I’ve been thinking a lot about these three areas and how I can really take them to the next level. I have some initial thoughts of my own, and I’d be happy to talk about those, but I’d actually like to get your thoughts first. In your eyes, what would be the most meaningful things I can do in these three areas to really be considered a top performer? Boss: Hm  .  .  . I’m not really sure. Maybe blah, blah, and blah. You: Yeah, I agree— we’re on the same page here. So here’s what I was thinking: Specifically, I’d like to achieve goals A, B, and C, and I’d like to do all this in six months. That’s pretty aggressive, but I think it’s doable. Would you agree that’s something that you’d like to see from me, and that it would also help peg me as a top performer? Boss: Yes, it would. That sounds perfect. You: Okay, great. I really appreciate it, Boss. So I’ll get to work on this and keep you in the loop with a status update every four weeks as usual. The last thing I’d like to talk about is: If I do an extraordinary job, then at the end of the six months all I ask is that we sit down to discuss a possible compensation adjustment. But let’s cross that bridge when we get to it, OK? Boss: Sounds fine. Looking forward to seeing what you can do. You: Great. I’ll type up these notes and send them to you. Thanks again!</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Location 3305</div><div class='noteText'>1. Her paycheck goes to her checking account by direct deposit.
2. Automatic Money Flow begins transferring money out of her checking account.
3. Her system also automatically pays her fixed costs. Most of her subscriptions and bills are automatically paid by her credit card. The utilities and loans are automatically paid out of her checking account.
4. The credit card company automatically emails her bill for a 5-minute review and the bill is also automatically paid by her checking account.
5. The money that remains in her account is used for guilt-free spending money. She knows that no matter what, she’s already hit her savings and investing goals before she spends a cent of her guilt-free money.
6. She sets alerts in YNAB to notify her if she goes over her spending goals, and she keeps a reserve of $ 500 in her checking account just in case. (The couple of times she over-spent, she paid herself back by using her “unexpected expenses” sub-savings account.)

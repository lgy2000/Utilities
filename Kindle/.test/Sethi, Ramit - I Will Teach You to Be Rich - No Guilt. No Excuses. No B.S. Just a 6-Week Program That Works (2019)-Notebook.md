## Would You Rather Be Sexy or Rich?
- The 85 Percent Solution: Getting started is more important than becoming an expert. Too many of us get overwhelmed thinking we need to manage our money perfectly, which leads us to do nothing at all. That’s why the easiest way to manage your money is to take it one step at a time— and not worry about being perfect. I’d rather act and get it 85 percent right than do nothing. Think about it: 85 percent of the way is far better than zero percent. Once your money system is good enough— or 85 percent of the way there— you can get on with your life and go do the things you really want to do.

- It’s okay to make mistakes. It’s better to make them now, with a little bit of money, so that when you have more, you’ll know what to avoid.

- Don’t live in the spreadsheet. I encourage you to pick your financial system and move on with your life, which means not “living in the spreadsheet,” or obsessing over every tiny change in your spending and in the market.

- Focus on the Big Wins— the five to ten things that get you disproportionate results, including automating your savings and investing, finding a job you love, and negotiating your salary. Get the Big Wins right and you can order as many lattes as you want.

- Investing should be very boring— and very profitable— over the long term.

- There’s a limit to how much you can cut, but no limit to how much you can earn. I have readers who earn $ 50,000/ year and ones who earn $ 750,000/ year. They both buy the same loaves of bread. Controlling spending is important, but your earnings become super-linear.
	- Highlight ( yellow ) - Location 499
- Build a collection of “spending frameworks” to use when deciding on buying something. Most people default to restrictive rules (“ I need to cut back on eating out...”), but you can flip it and decide what you’ll always spend on, like my book-buying rule: If you’re thinking about buying a book, just buy it. Don’t waste even five seconds debating it.

- Sometimes the most advanced thing you can do is the basics, consistently.

- Part of creating your Rich Life is the willingness to be unapologetically different. Once money isn’t a primary constraint, you’ll have the freedom to design your own Rich Life, which will almost certainly be different from the average person’s.

IN WEEK 2, you’ll set up the right bank accounts. IN WEEK 3, you’ll open a 401( k) and an investment account (even if you have just $ 100 to start). IN WEEK 4, you’ll figure out how much you’re spending. And then you’ll figure out how to make your money go where you want it to go. IN WEEK 5, you’ll automate your new infrastructure to make your accounts play together nicely. IN WEEK 6, you’ll learn why investing isn’t the same as picking stocks— and how you can get the most out of the market with very little work.

## Optimize Your Credit Cards
- How to beat the credit card companies at their own game
	- Highlight ( yellow ) - Location 546
- It’s not worth negotiating everything, but there are a few areas of life where negotiation is a Big Win.
	- Highlight ( yellow ) - Location 569
- Credit cards give you thousands of dollars worth of perks. If you pay your bill on time, they’re a free short-term loan. They can help you keep track of your spending much more easily than cash, and they let you download your transaction history for free. Most offer free warranty extensions on your purchases and free rental car insurance. Many offer rewards and points worth hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Credit cards are also convenient enemies. Almost everyone has a bad story about late fees, unauthorized charges, or overspending.
	- Highlight ( yellow ) - Location 595
- The truth about credit cards lies somewhere between these two extremes. As long as you manage them well, they’re worth having. But if you don’t completely pay off your bill at the end of the month, you’ll owe an enormous amount of interest on the remainder, usually about 14 percent. This is what’s known as the annual percentage rate, or APR. Credit card companies also tack on a whopping fee every time you miss a payment— usually around $ 35. It’s also easy to overuse credit cards and find yourself in debt, as many American credit card users have done.
	- Highlight ( yellow ) - Location 601
- instead of playing defense by avoiding credit cards altogether, I want you to play offense by using credit cards responsibly and getting as many benefits out of them as possible. To do so, you need to optimize your credit card( s) and use them as a spearhead to improve your overall credit. By the end of this chapter, you’ll know how to squeeze the credit card companies for everything they’re worth— without paying unnecessary fees— and you’ll know how to use your cards to boost your all-important credit score.

- When I was traveling with my fiancée to see her family in Dubai, I surprised her with a three-night stay at a resort in the desert that could only be described as 7-star. We had a private villa in traditional bedouin style overlooking the Dubai desert with a private pool, and all meals at the resort were provided. The whole experience easily would have cost $ 2,000-plus a night, but I did the whole thing for free with points.

- establishing good credit is the first step in building an infrastructure for getting rich. Think about it: Our largest purchases are almost always made on credit, and people with good credit save tens of thousands of dollars on these purchases. Credit has a far greater impact on your finances than saving a few dollars a day on a cup of coffee.
	- Highlight ( yellow ) - Location 664
- There are two main components to your credit (also known as your credit history): your credit report and your credit score.
	- Highlight ( yellow ) - Location 666
- Your credit report gives potential lenders basic information about you, your accounts, and your payment history. It tracks all credit-related activities (e.g., credit cards and loans), although recent activities are given higher weight.
	- Highlight ( orange ) - Location 668
- Your credit score (often called your FICO score because it was created by the Fair Isaac Corporation) is a single, easy-to-read number between 300 and 850 that represents your credit risk to lenders. It’s like an SAT score for the credit industry (higher is better). The lenders take this number and, with a few other pieces of information, such as your salary and age, decide if they’ll lend you money for credit like a credit card, mortgage, or car loan. They’ll charge you more or less for the loan depending on your score, which signifies how risky you are.
	- Highlight ( orange ) - Location 670
- Once a year, by law, you’re allowed to obtain your credit report for free at annualcreditreport.com. It includes basic information about all your accounts and payment history. Lots of people use Credit Karma (creditkarma.com) to get a free credit score, but I prefer the official credit score from MyFico (myfico.com), which is more accurate even though it has a small fee.
	- Highlight ( yellow ) - Location 675
- a high credit score can save you tens of thousands of dollars over your lifetime (or more if you live in a high-cost-of-living area). While other people spend many hours cutting coupons, agonizing over generic brands at the grocery store, or beating themselves up over a morning latte, they’re failing to see the bigger picture. It’s fine to keep a close eye on your expenses, but you should focus on spending time on the things that matter, the Big Wins. So let’s dig into tactics for improving your credit, which is quantifiably worth much more than any advice about frugality.
	- **1. Get rewarded for your spending**
	- Highlight ( orange ) - Location 705
- One of the biggest problems with credit cards is the hidden cost of using them. It may be incredibly convenient to swipe your card at every retailer, but if you don’t pay your bill every month, you’ll end up owing way more than you realize.
	- Highlight ( yellow ) - Location 737
- How do you choose the right credit card? I have a few simple rules that I use when choosing my own cards: ■   Don’t accept credit card offers that come in the mail or from retail stores like Gap or Nordstrom. ■   Squeeze every reward you can out of your credit cards. ■   Pick a good one, then move on with your life.
	- Highlight ( yellow ) - Location 755
- Get rewarded for your spending. There are different levels of rewards cards. Some are very basic, while others offer hundreds of dollars in annual benefits— or even thousands, depending on how much you spend. First, decide what you want to get rewarded with— cash back or travel. I recommend cash back because it’s straightforward, there are excellent cash back cards, and it’s simpler than travel rewards, which require more sophistication to truly maximize. (For more on maximizing travel rewards, look up forums on “credit card churning.”) Once you decide on the primary reward you want, use a site like bankrate.com to sort through your options.
	- Highlight ( yellow ) - Location 760
- Most of the best rewards cards have fees. Are they worth it? You should run the numbers to decide, which takes less than 5 minutes. Here’s a quick rule of thumb: If you spend thousands per month on your credit card, the rewards are usually worth it. But if you spend more modestly or you’re not sure whether you want to pay a fee, spend a few minutes doing a quick analysis by searching for “credit card rewards calculator.”

- This person just opened one of the most predatory cards out there to save $ 4. Jesus. You might as well reach into a dirty gutter to find a few pennies. That would be cheaper than the financial beating you’re going to eventually take.
	- **Don’t sign up for retail store credit cards.**

- Why would you sign up for a retail store card that has high fees, near-extortionate interest rates, and terrible rewards?

- A secret of the credit card industry: When you compare credit cards online, you’re entering a murky world of SEO and affiliate fees where nearly all credit card listings are compensated.
	- Highlight ( yellow ) - Location 791
- Don’t go card crazy. Now that you’re in the market, you might be tempted by any number of card offers. But don’t overdo it.
	- Highlight ( yellow ) - Location 797
- each additional card you get means added complexity for your personal finance system: more to keep track of and more places for things to go wrong. Two or three is a good rule of thumb. (The average American has four credit cards.)
	- Highlight ( orange ) - Location 798
- My online business profile didn’t have my latest address so I never received statements. For 34 months, my bank account got charged $ 60.
	- Highlight ( blue ) - Location 800
- I ended up paying ~ $ 2,000 for a $ 3,000 initial balance. It completely smoked my confidence. I closed down all 11 of my cards except my CSP. Technically I’m still “ahead” but the thought of having paid $ 2,000 when I *didn’t have to* and it was *100% avoidable and in my control* was too much.
	- Highlight ( blue ) - Location 803
- there are other sources of credit besides credit cards. These include installment loans (such as auto loans), personal lines of credit, home equity lines of credit, and service credit (such as utilities).

- cautioning against prescribing a specific number of credit sources. “It depends on how long you’ve been managing credit. The less information in your credit report, the higher the prominence of each new report.

- In short, pick two or three great cards, maximize rewards sensibly, and remember that these cards are just one part of your overall financial infrastructure.
	- Highlight ( orange ) - Location 811
- Years ago, I decided to optimize my credit card rewards. I knew I was about 95 percent of the way there— I had cash back and travel cards for my business and personal spending— but I wanted to get truly dialed in for that last 5 percent. As my business had grown to dozens of employees, my spending had increased considerably. These rewards started to become meaningful and I wanted to be sure I was getting every benefit available. For example, at a certain point, we were spending over $ 40,000 on ads every month. I know most people don’t need to maximize points at this level. But I think it’s fascinating, and I want to share what I learned.

- your debt payment history represents 35 percent of your credit score— the largest chunk. In fact, the single most important thing you can do to improve your credit is to pay your bills on time.
	- Highlight ( yellow ) - Location 851
- Today, most people pay their credit card bills online, but if you haven’t set up automatic payment yet, log on to your credit card’s website to do so now.
	- Highlight ( yellow ) - Location 858
- You’ll get a statement from your card company each month before the payment goes through so that you can adjust your payment as needed.
	- Highlight ( yellow ) - Location 860
- Awful Consequences If you miss even one payment on your credit card, here are four terrible, horrible, no good, very bad results you may face: 1. Your credit score can drop more than 100 points, which would add $ 227/ month to an average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. 2. Your APR can go up to 30 percent. 3. You’ll be charged a late fee, usually around $ 35. 4. Your late payment can trigger rate increases on your other credit cards as well, even if you’ve never been late on them.
	- Highlight ( orange ) - Location 866
- 2. Try to get fees on your cards waived. This can be a great way to optimize your credit cards, because your credit card companies will do all the work for you. Call them using the phone number on the back of the card and ask if you’re paying any fees, including annual fees or service charges.
	- Highlight ( orange ) - Location 875
- You: Hi, I’d like to confirm that I’m not paying any fees on my credit card. Credit card rep: Well, it looks like you have an annual fee of $ 100. That’s actually one of our better rates. You: I’d rather pay no fees. Can you waive this year’s annual fee?
	- Highlight ( pink ) - Location 878
- Earlier I mentioned that it can be worth paying annual fees for rewards cards. This is true— but why not ask? Remember, credit card companies compete ferociously with each other, which can benefit you. Call them a month before your new annual fee kicks in and ask them to waive it.
	- Highlight ( yellow ) - Location 881
- If you decide that your credit card fee isn’t worth it, ask your credit card company what they’ll do for you. If they waive your fees, great! If not, switch to a no-fee card. I suggest you do this at the same credit card company to simplify your life—
	- Highlight ( yellow ) - Location 883
- 3. Negotiate a lower APR. Your APR, or annual percentage rate, is the interest rate your credit card company charges you. APRs fluctuate, but in general, they hover around 13 to 16 percent.
	- Highlight ( orange ) - Location 886
- call your credit card company and ask them to lower your APR. If they ask why, tell them you’ve been paying your bill in full on time for the last few months, and you know there are a number of credit cards offering better rates than you’re currently getting.
	- Highlight ( yellow ) - Location 891
- APR doesn’t technically matter if you’re paying your bills in full every month— you could have a 2 percent APR or 80 percent APR and it would be irrelevant, since you don’t pay interest if you pay your total bill each month.
	- Highlight ( orange ) - Location 894
- 4. Keep your main cards for a long time, and keep them active— but also keep them simple. Lenders like to see a long history of credit, which means that the longer you hold an account, the more valuable it is for your credit score.
	- Highlight ( orange ) - Location 898
- Don’t get suckered by introductory offers and low APRs— if you’re happy with your card, keep it. Some credit card companies will cancel your account after a certain period of inactivity. To avoid having a card you rarely use shut down, set up an automatic payment on it.
	- Highlight ( yellow ) - Location 900
- Play it safe: If you have a credit card, keep it active using an automatic payment at least once every three months.
	- Highlight ( yellow ) - Location 904
- Some of my readers have opened over twenty-plus cards to “churn” rewards, and now they can’t keep track of all their cards. This is where you have to make a decision on risk versus reward and simplicity versus complexity.
	- Highlight ( yellow ) - Location 907
- You: Hi, I noticed I missed a payment, and I wanted to confirm that this won’t affect my credit score. Credit card rep: Let me check on that. No, the late fee will be applied, but it won’t affect your credit score. (Note: If you pay within a few days of your missed bill, it usually won’t be reported to the credit agencies. But ask to be sure.) You: Thank you! I’m really happy to hear that. Now, about that fee... I understand I was late, but I’d like to have it waived. Credit card rep: Why? You: It was a mistake. It won’t happen again, so I’d like to have the fee removed. (Note: Always end your sentence with strength. Don’t say, “Can you remove this?” Say, “I’d like to have this removed.”) At this point, you have a better-than-50-percent chance of getting the fee credited to your account.

You: I’m sorry, but I’ve been a customer for four years and I’d hate for this one fee to drive me away from your service. What can you do to remove the late fee? Credit card rep: Hmm... Let me check on that... Yes, I was able to remove the fee this time. It’s been credited to your account.

- 5. Get more credit. (Warning! Do this only if you have no debt.) This one is counterintuitive,
	- **This tip is only for the financially responsible people.**
	- Highlight ( orange ) - Location 932
- This tip is only for people who have no credit card debt and pay their bills in full each month. It’s not for anyone else.
	- Highlight ( yellow ) - Location 937
- It involves getting more credit to improve something called your credit utilization rate, which is simply how much you owe divided by your available credit.
	- Highlight ( orange ) - Location 939
- Lower is preferred because lenders don’t want you regularly spending all the money you have available through credit—
	- Highlight ( yellow ) - Location 942
- To improve your credit utilization rate, you have two choices: Stop carrying so much debt on your credit cards (even if you pay it off each month) or increase your total available credit.
	- Highlight ( orange ) - Location 943
- You: Hi, I’d like to request a credit increase. I currently have five thousand dollars available, and I’d like ten thousand. Credit card rep: Why are you requesting a credit increase? You: I’ve been paying my bill in full for the last eighteen months and I have some upcoming purchases. I’d like a credit limit of ten thousand dollars. Can you approve my request? Rep: Sure. I’ve put in a request for this increase. It should be activated in about seven days.
	- Highlight ( pink ) - Location 947
- I request a credit-limit increase every six to twelve months. Remember, 30 percent of your credit score is represented by your credit utilization rate.
	- Highlight ( orange ) - Location 952
- got credit cards with reasonable limits ($ 500). Sure, I had no income, but that didn’t seem important at the time. Wouldn’t you know it, I was responsible enough to have my limit raised to $ 2,000 after a very short period of time! Except that I wasn’t actually responsible, and I paid thousands of dollars in interest and late fees and wrecked my credit rating for several years. It took many years for us to clear up this debt.
	- Highlight ( blue ) - Location 955
- 6. Use your credit card’s secret perks! Before I get into rewards programs, let me say this: Just like with car insurance, you can get great deals on your credit when you’re a responsible customer.
	- Highlight ( orange ) - Location 960
- you should call your credit cards and lenders once a year to ask them what advantages you’re eligible for. Often, they can waive fees, extend credit, and give you private promotions that others don’t have access to.

- “Hi there. I checked my credit and noticed that I have a 750 credit score, which is pretty good. I’ve been a customer of yours for the last four years, so I’m wondering what special promotions and offers you have for me... I’m thinking of fee waivers and special offers that you use for customer retention.”

- Did you know that credit cards automatically give you amazing consumer protection?
	- **1. Automatic warranty doubling**
	- Highlight ( orange ) - Location 969
- Automatic warranty doubling: Most cards extend the warranty on your purchases. So if you buy an iPhone and it breaks after Apple’s warranty expires, your credit card will still cover it up to an additional year. This is true for nearly every credit card for nearly every purchase, automatically.

	- Highlight ( blue ) - Location 974
- Trip-cancellation insurance: If you book tickets for a vacation and then get sick and can’t travel, your airline will charge you hefty fees to rebook your ticket. Just call your credit card and ask for the trip-cancellation insurance to kick in, and they’ll cover those change fees— usually between $ 3,000 to $ 10,000 per trip.

- they borrow money from the card at this low rate and stick it in a high-interest savings account, which allows them to profit off the interest. Some actually invest the money in short-term CDs or even stocks. At the end, they plan to return the money and keep the interest. I find these zero percent credit card games to be a huge waste of time. Sure, you can make a few bucks a year, or maybe even a few hundred, but the time, risk of mismanaging the process, and possibility of screwing up your credit score just aren’t worth it. Most important, this is a distraction that gets you only short-term results. You’re much better off building a personal finance infrastructure that focuses on long-term growth, not on getting a few bucks here or there.

- But I have no sympathy for people who complain without a plan. And a plan means that if you’re in debt, you should know how much you owe and the exact day your debt will be paid off.

- Pay Your Debt Off Aggressively If you’ve found yourself in credit card debt— whether it’s a lot or a little— you have a triple whammy working against you: ■   First, you’re paying tons of high interest on the balance you’re carrying. ■   Second, your credit score suffers— 30 percent of your credit score is based on how much debt you have— putting you into a downward spiral of trying to get credit to get a house, car, or apartment and having to pay even more because of your poor credit. ■   Third, and potentially most damaging, debt can affect you emotionally. It can overwhelm you, leading you to avoid opening your bills, causing more late payments and more debt, in a vicious circle of doom. It’s time to make sacrifices to pay off your debt quickly. Otherwise, you’re costing yourself more and more every day.

- You: Hi. I’m going to be paying off my credit card debt more aggressively beginning next week, and I’d like a lower APR. Credit card rep: Uh, why? You: I’ve decided to be more aggressive about paying off my debt, and that’s why I’d like a lower APR. Other cards are offering me rates at half of what you’re offering. Can you lower my rate by 50 percent, or only 40 percent? Credit card rep: Hmm... After reviewing your account, I’m afraid we can’t offer you a lower APR. We can offer you a credit limit increase, however. You: No, that won’t work for me. Like I mentioned, other credit cards are offering me zero percent introductory rates for twelve months, as well as APRs of half what you’re offering. I’ve been a customer for X years, and I’d prefer not to switch my balance over to a low-interest card. Can you match the other credit card rates, or can you go lower? Credit card rep: I see... Hmm, let me pull something up here. Fortunately, the system is suddenly letting me offer you a reduced APR. That is effective immediately.

- Decide where the money to pay off your credit cards will come from.
	- **Ways:**
	- Highlight ( orange ) - Location 1373
- Balance transfers. Many people begin by considering a balance transfer to a card with a lower APR. I’m not a fan of these. Yes, it can help for a few months and save you some money, particularly on large balances.
	- Highlight ( yellow ) - Location 1377
- As we just discussed, a better option is to call and negotiate the APR down on your current accounts.

- Taking money from a 401( k) or home equity line of credit (heloc). I don’t recommend either of these options.
	- Highlight ( yellow ) - Location 1383
- People with credit card debt often find it difficult to reduce spending and end up getting back into debt after tapping their 401( k) or HELOC. If you use your HELOC money to pay off credit cards, you’ll risk losing your home if you run up more debt.

- In this chapter, the antidote to unconscious spending, we’re going to gently create a new, simple way of spending. It’s time to stop wondering where all your money goes each month. I’m going to help you redirect it to the places you choose, like investing, saving, and even spending more on the things you love (but less on the things you don’t).

- Unfortunately, most Americans were never taught how to consciously spend, which means cutting costs mercilessly on the things you don’t love, but spending extravagantly on the things you do. Instead, we were taught to generically apply the principle of “Don’t spend money on that!” to everything, meaning we try half-heartedly to cut back, fail, then guiltily berate ourselves— and continue overspending on things we don’t even care about.

Would a 15-minute chat next week be okay? If so, how about I swing by your desk Monday morning at 10 a.m.? Thanks, Your Name

- You: Hi Boss, thanks for taking the time to meet with me. As I mentioned, I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about the position and what I can do to really be a top performer this year, and I’d like to discuss that with you if that’s okay. Boss: Sure. You: So the way I see it, my role in the position can be broken down into three main areas: A, B, and C. I think I’m doing pretty well with A, and I’m picking up B pretty rapidly. And I need a little help with C, as we’ve discussed before. Does that sound about right to you? Boss: Yes, that sounds right. You: I’ve been thinking a lot about these three areas and how I can really take them to the next level. I have some initial thoughts of my own, and I’d be happy to talk about those, but I’d actually like to get your thoughts first. In your eyes, what would be the most meaningful things I can do in these three areas to really be considered a top performer? Boss: Hm... I’m not really sure. Maybe blah, blah, and blah. You: Yeah, I agree— we’re on the same page here. So here’s what I was thinking: Specifically, I’d like to achieve goals A, B, and C, and I’d like to do all this in six months. That’s pretty aggressive, but I think it’s doable. Would you agree that’s something that you’d like to see from me, and that it would also help peg me as a top performer? Boss: Yes, it would. That sounds perfect. You: Okay, great. I really appreciate it, Boss. So I’ll get to work on this and keep you in the loop with a status update every four weeks as usual. The last thing I’d like to talk about is: If I do an extraordinary job, then at the end of the six months all I ask is that we sit down to discuss a possible compensation adjustment. But let’s cross that bridge when we get to it, OK? Boss: Sounds fine. Looking forward to seeing what you can do. You: Great. I’ll type up these notes and send them to you. Thanks again!

- “ You didn’t hit those goals.” If you genuinely didn’t hit your goals, you should have communicated that earlier and decided on a plan of action with your boss. But if your boss is simply using this as an excuse— to obfuscate what the goals were, or to move the goalposts— here’s your response: “If there are areas for me to grow, I’d love to discuss them. But on [date], you and I agreed to these goals. And I’ve sent you a weekly update since then. I’m all for exceeding goals— which I’ve done, as you can see from [Specific Project]— but I want to be compensated in good faith.”

	- **30 percent— Domestic equities**
	- Highlight ( orange ) - Location 4617
- asset allocation is that you can actually reduce your risk while maintaining an equivalent return.
	- Highlight ( orange ) - Location 4619
- the most popular companies: Vanguard, Schwab, and T. Rowe Price;
	- Highlight ( orange ) - Location 4623
- as a general guideline, you can create a great asset allocation using anywhere from three to seven funds. That would cover domestic equities, international equities, real estate investment trusts, and perhaps a small allocation to treasury bonds.
	- Highlight ( orange ) - Location 4628
- The first thing you want to do when picking index funds is to minimize fees. Look for the management fees (“ expense ratios”) to be low, around 0.2 percent, and you’ll be fine. Most of the index funds at Vanguard, T. Rowe Price, and Fidelity offer excellent value.

- By investing at regular intervals over time, you hedge against any drops in the price— and if your fund does drop, you’ll pick up shares at a discount price. In other words, by investing over time, you don’t try to time the market. You use time to your advantage.
	- Highlight ( orange ) - Location 4672

- You are more likely to bring up money than they are. And you have the perfect excuse— this book. Like this: “Mom, I’ve been reading this book on personal finance. I learned a lot of things I never knew. How did you learn about money?”
	- Highlight ( pink ) - Location 5300
- If your parents are in debt, it can be very tough on your relationship with them. Your biggest challenge is not going to be coming up with a technical personal finance solution for their problem. Instead, it’s going to be asking lots of questions, listening carefully, and deciding if they actually want help, and if they’re ready to receive it.

If they say “win the lottery,” encourage them. What would that mean? What would they do? Then get more realistic: “Okay, let’s assume you can’t win the lottery. What would your ideal situation look like five years from now?” Most parents have pragmatic dreams.) ■   How much do they make per month? How much do they spend? ■   What percentage of their income are they saving? (Almost nobody knows this. Be reassuring, not judgmental.) ■   Do they pay fees for their bank accounts and credit cards? ■   What’s their average monthly credit card balance? Out of curiosity (use that phrase), why isn’t it zero? How could they get it there? ■   Do they have any investments? If so, how did they choose them? ■   Do they own a mutual fund or funds? How much are they paying in fees? ■   Are they maximizing their 401( k) s, at least contributing as much as their company matches? ■   What about other retirement vehicles, like a Roth IRA? Do they have one?

I don’t think we’ll ever need to use a prenup, but it’s important to me that I protect the assets I’ve accumulated before we get married.” I emphasized marriage was about creating a team. “When we get married, we’re a team. I want you to know I’ll look out for you, and I know you’ll look out for me.” I emphasized our lifestyle. “You and I grew up almost the same. Both our moms are teachers. You see what I spend my money on— it’s not sports cars or bottle service. It’s basically living a comfortable life (with a few nice things). I love sharing this lifestyle with you and with our families.” But I was firm about wanting to sign a prenup. “I’m proud of what I’ve accomplished with my business and finances.

	- Highlight ( orange ) - Location 5689
- When it comes to you, your manager cares about two things— how you’re going to make him or her look better, and how you’re going to help the company do well.
	- Highlight ( yellow ) - Location 5691
- Negotiating tactic: Always frame your negotiation requests in a way that shows how the company will benefit. Don’t focus on the amount you’ll cost the company. Instead, illustrate how much value you can provide the company.

- 3. Come prepared (99 percent of people don’t). Don’t just pick a salary out of thin air.
	- Highlight ( orange ) - Location 5704
- Negotiating tactic: Most of the negotiation happens outside the room. Call your contacts. Figure out the salary amount you’d love, what you can realistically get, and what you’ll settle for. And don’t just ask for money. Literally bring a strategic plan of what you want to do in the position and hand it to your hiring manager.
	- Highlight ( orange ) - Location 5708
- in a job interview, you’ll want to have a list of things in your head that you can use to strengthen your negotiation. Think about your strong points and figure out ways you might be able to bring them to the hiring manager’s attention.

Don’t forget to discuss whether or not the company offers a bonus, stock options, flexible commuting, or further education.
	- Highlight ( orange ) - Location 5720
- Negotiating tactic: Your line is “Let’s talk about total comp,” which refers to your total compensation— not just salary, but everything. Treat them each as levers: If you pull one up, you can afford to let another fall. Use the levers strategically— for example, by conceding something you don’t really care about— so you can both come to a happy agreement.

- Here’s how I did it: When I decided to buy— at the end of December, when salespeople are desperate to meet their quotas— I reached out to seventeen car dealers and told them exactly which car I wanted. I said I was prepared to buy the car within two weeks and, because I knew exactly how much profit they would make off the car, I would go with the lowest price offered to me. The same day, as I sat back with a cup of Earl Grey tea and three tacos with habanero salsa, responses started rolling in from the dealers. After I had all the offers, I called the dealers, told them the lowest price I’d received, and gave each of them a chance to beat it. This resulted in a bidding war that led to a downward spiral of near-orgasmic deals.

- As soon as you buy your car, enter the major maintenance checkpoints into your calendar so you remember them. Here’s a hint: The average car is driven about fifteen thousand miles per year. You can use that number as a starting point to calculate a maintenance schedule based on the car manufacturer’s instructions. Of course, you also need to have regular oil changes, watch your tire pressure, and keep your car clean. I keep a record of each service I have, along with any notes. When I sell my car, I’ll show the documentation to the buyer to prove how meticulous I’ve been (and charge the buyer accordingly).

	- Highlight ( orange ) - Location 5920
- When you buy a house worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, you should be an expert on common mistakes most home buyers make. You should know all the common real estate terms, as well as how to push and pull to get the best deal. And you should understand that houses are primarily for living in, not for making huge cash gains.

I can’t cover all the tips here, but I’ll get you started with the basics.
	- Highlight ( yellow ) - Location 5930
- Actually, houses really aren’t very good investments in general.
	- Highlight ( yellow ) - Location 5937
- In the olden days, this meant that your house would cost no more than 2.5 times your annual income, you’d be able to put at least 20 percent of the purchase price down, and the total monthly payments (including the mortgage, maintenance, insurance, and taxes) would be about 30 percent of your gross income.
	- Highlight ( orange ) - Location 5938
- Can you afford at least a 20 percent down payment for the house? If not, set a savings goal and don’t even think about buying until you reach it. Even if you’ve got a down payment, you still need to be sure you make enough money to cover the monthly payments.

They’re called that for a reason— they’re simple houses that require you to make trade-offs but allow you to get started. Your first house probably won’t have as many bedrooms as you want. It won’t be in the most amazing location. But it will let you get started making consistent monthly payments and building equity.

- Buy only if you’re planning to live in the same place for ten years or more.
	- Highlight ( orange ) - Location 5963
- Buying a house changes your lifestyle forever. No matter what, you have to make your monthly payment every month— or you’ll lose your house and watch your credit tank. This affects the kinds of jobs you can take and your level of risk tolerance. It means you’ll need to save for a six-month emergency plan in case you lose your job and can’t pay your mortgage. In short, you really need to be sure you’re ready for the responsibility of being a homeowner.
